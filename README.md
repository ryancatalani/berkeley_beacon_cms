# Beacon CMS

This was the content management system for [The Berkeley Beacon](http://www.berkeleybeacon.com) between 2011 and 2017. It featured the first custom responsive design for a college newspaper, according to [Nieman Lab](http://www.niemanlab.org/2012/04/emerson-college-student-paper-completes-a-fully-responsive-mobile-friendly-redesign/).

Developed and designed by [Ryan Catalani](http://ryancatalani.com).
