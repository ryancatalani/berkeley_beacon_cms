	<p class="explanation">
		At Emerson, one credit <a href="http://www.emerson.edu/billing/costs-billing-schedules/undergraduate" target="_blank">costs</a> $1,145, and one credit is <a href="http://www.emerson.edu/policy/credit-hour-definition" target="_blank">worth</a> approximately 15 hours of classroom instruction per semester (or one hour of classroom instruction for 15 weeks). This means each hour of classroom instruction is worth approximately $76.33. To calculate the total value of Emerson's snow days, the number of class hours per day entered is multiplied by the number of days canceled (currently <span class="updatable_mondays"></span> Mondays, <span class="updatable_mondays_after"></span> Monday after 4 p.m., <span class="updatable_tuesdays"></span> Tuesdays, and <span class="updatable_wednesdays"></span> Wednesday). This calculation does not account for potential makeup days. Photo by Jack Bushell / Beacon Correspondent. Update: A previous version of this feature linked to the <a href="http://www.emerson.edu/admission/graduate-admission/tuition-expenses/tuition-cost" target="_blank">graduate tuition page</a>; it is now linked to the undergraduate tuition page. The cost per credit is the same for undergraduate and graduate students, so the calculation is not affected.
