<p>The Berkeley Beacon is Emerson College's independent, student-run newspaper. Founded in 1947, the weekly publishes in print on Thursdays each fall and spring semester and online daily. The paper is a chronicle of life at Emerson -- covering student government politics, campus performances, and school-wide trends. In recent years, the paper's reporting has revealed racial biases in the college's tenure practices, performance space struggles for student groups, and food code violations in the campus dining facilities.</p>

<p>In 2011, the paper took strides in increasing its online presence by launching the first college newspaper website built on HTML5, following The Boston Globe's release of BostonGlobe.com, the world's first HTML5, responsive-designed newspaper site.</p>
