The nominations will be narrowed down, and a poll of 2013 class members will determine the final beneficiary.Burch said the idea rose after she and other council members brainstormed ideas to connect with their classmates.</div>\n<div>\n\n“While something great comes out of uniting a class, I think something really great would be all of us deciding where we are going to contribute this money,” the acting major said.\n\nAccording to Burch, classes typically have little to no say in what happens with their money. The funds raised during junior year are usually put towards a jam-packed senior year of events, including senior week. Elizabeth Mantey, vice president of the junior class, said she is excited to change the standard.\n\n“We wanted the class as a whole to really have a say in where the money went,” the visual, media, arts major said.\n\nAccording to Mantey, the class funds are still sufficient enough to put towards senior week. Additional money raised for the class this year will broaden the budget, allowing for extra to be given to the beneficiary.\n\nPaige Sammartino, said she thinks highly of the idea.\n\n“There are so many places our money could go and I think charity is one of the best options,” the junior writing, literature, and publishing major said.\n\nAlyssa Macaluso, however, doesn’t think a poll through Facebook is an effective way to get the attention of the student body.\n\n“Honestly, there is not enough time. You get so many [Facebook] events at one time and basically just become numb to it,” the design technology major said. “Facebook events as a whole are like an invitation to a bachelor party.”\n\nDespite Malcuso’s idea of the event, students have already made submissions. Suggestions for a beneficiary have included class of 2013-specific funds and students as well as local Boston charities. Submissions for beneficiaries end on Sept. 24, and a poll for the final choices will run from Sept. 26 to Oct. 2.\n\nMantey said she hopes other class councils latch on to the idea and start putting their funds to causes outside Emerson.\n\n“It would be really awesome if people jumped on the bandwagon and did that,” she said.\n\n</div>","dt":"2011-09-22 14:22:33 -0700"},"849":{"terms":[{"id":6,"name":"News"}],"title":"Oldest theatre in Boston shuts down temporarily","body":"<div><strong><strong>Jeannie Rodriguez, Beacon Staff</strong></strong></div>\n<div>Boston’s oldest continuously operating theater closed its doors this summer with no projection of when it will open again. The Colonial Theatre went dark in July after negotiations failed between Emerson College, owner of the theater, and Broadway Across</div>\n<div>America-Boston, the organization that has leased the theater over the last decade.Andrew Tiedemann, vice president of communications and marketing at Emerson College, said the closure of the theater resulted from bad timing and lack of communication between the two parties.</div>\n<div>Anticipating that its Colonial lease would end on August 31, 2011, Broadway Across America-Boston approached Emerson in January 2010 to sign a new deal. Tiedemann said the college told its longtime tenants that it first wanted to explore other potential producers to lease the theater before signing a contract.</div>\n<div>\n\nThat led Broadway Across America-Boston to seek other options, too. When Emerson came back to them to renegotiate the original deal, it was too late.\n\n“Of course, nobody wants to see [the Colonial] go dark,” said Rich Jaffe, Broadway Across America- Boston vice president, to the Boston Globe. “But you get to the point where you have to find a venue for your productions.”\n\nAccording to their website, Broadway Across America-Boston will present two musicals next season at the Shubert Theatre, part of the Citi Performing Arts Center. The remainder of the theatre company’s nine-production season will be presented at the Boston Opera House.\n\nEmerson is using the period of time the Colonial is closed to upgrade the sprinkler system, with renovations taking place in August and September. Tiedemann said Emerson would have had to close the theater to make these changes regardless of the scheduling conflict.\n\n“This is Emerson College; we’re theater people,” Tiedemann said. “We can’t see the future, but hopefully this isn’t for long.”\n\nHe said the college is continuing to negotiate with prospective tenants but declined to give the names of any potential leasers.\n\nLuke Jones, a graduate student and graphic designer for ArtsEmerson, said he is not too concerned about the Colonial closing.\n\n“I've heard it through the Emerson grapevine that Broadway Across America will most likely eventually renegotiate for it and it will probably reopen in a year or two,” Jones said.\n\nTheater education student Chris Sawey said he is saddened by the theater’s closing and hopes Emerson fills the vacancy soon.\n\n“Who could possibly be better than Broadway Across America?” Sawey said. “The great thing about the Colonial Theatre was that it brought people from all over the city, but who knows, maybe this is part of Emerson’s master plan of some sort. It’s just a matter of time before they see it take a toll on the community.”\n\n</div>","dt":"2011-09-08 17:28:04 -0700"},"680":{"terms":[{"id":10,"name":"Student of the Week"}],"title":"Student of the Week: David Levine","body":"<div>If asked to describe my roommate David “Daddy D” Levine in three words, I would go with tall, Jewish, and film-major. But that hardly begins to describe him. David is like a Russian doll with all of his different talents and passions stored up inside of him.&nbsp;\n\nAt the very least, he’s a triple threat: a student, a filmmaker, and a man.  As a film production major and a marketing minor, he excels in his classes to the point of classmates often mistaking him for a teacher’s assistant.  He puts that same intensity and brilliance into everything he does. He has worked on countless film shoots, he currently writes for The Common Agenda, and he’s an incredible ping-pong player. (Fun Fact: Levine is undefeated in ping-pong at the Boston University Hillel House.) Also, he co-created a condiment hybrid made up of honey mustard and barbeque sauce. It’s called Sauce-some or Awesome Sauce, and it’s incredible.\n\nBest of all, Levine doesn’t let his success get to him. He is one of the kindest, most down-to-earth people I have ever known.  I challenge you to picture the biggest thing you can possibly think of. Guess what? Levine’s heart is bigger than that.\n\nI wish I could tell you all about Levine’s success as a student and a person, but I’m writing a mini-profile, not a Russian novel.  Instead I will end with this: If there were more people like David Levine, the world could start again.\n\n</div>\n<div>-Brendan O’Brien</div>","dt":"2011-04-21 04:50:55 -0700"},"152":{"terms":[],"title":"Ad Rates","body":"<span style=\"color: #000000;\"> </span>\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\">The <em>Berkeley Beacon</em> is distributed for free every Thursday during the academic year, the 12-page newspaper covers college and local news, opinion and editorial content, Emerson athletics, lifestyle, and both Emerson and local arts. 2,500 copies are distributed to the Emerson community every week.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\"><strong>Demographics</strong></div>\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\">Emerson College’s current enrollment is 3,600 undergraduate students and 900</div>\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\">graduate students, with more than 400 faculty.</div>\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\">As the only institution in the country dedicated to communications and the arts, the</div>\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\">student body at Emerson is one of a kind.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\"><strong>Rate Card</strong></div>\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\"><em>Color:</em></div>\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\">Half page: $525</div>\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\">Quarter: $275</div>\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\">Eighth: $140</div>\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\"><em>Black and White:</em></div>\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\">Half page: $450</div>\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\">Quarter: $225</div>\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\">Eighth: $110</div>\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\">Volume buys may be discounted.

The five-page ethics paper due in five hours wasn’t going to write itself.\n\nHe couldn’t focus. Time was running out. He needed a quick fix.\n\n“I saw a friend of mine and he was like, ‘Oh, would you wanna try it?’” Brian, a visual and media arts major, recalled. “I figured, why not?”\n\n“It” was Concerta, Brian said, a spinoff of the prescription drug Ritalin and similar to Adderall. Each is prescribed to adolescents to help combat Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, according to the ADHD organization’s website, and can help improve the focus and ability to work of those who take it.\n\nStudents interviewed for this report said abuse of Adderall and Ritalin is common at Emerson and enables its users to get a high that increases their attentiveness and endurance.\n\nJane Powers, the director of Emerson’s center for health and wellness, provided the <em>Beacon </em>with statistics of Adderall and Ritalin abuse among the student body from a survey conducted last May.\n\n“At Emerson the reported use was 14% of the male and 11% of the female respondents had used either of these medications (Adderall and Ritalin) without prescription,” Powers said in an e-mail, adding that 579 students responded to the survey, about 20 percent of the entire student body.\n\nThis rate is higher than the national average, Powers said in her e-mail. Based on results from the American College Health Association’s National College Health Assessment survey, the nationwide response average was eight percent of male and six percent of female college students reported illegally using the drugs.\n\nPowers cautioned against the serious side affects of abusing these drugs and said the health center warns students who have prescriptions for these drugs to keep them in a locked, safe place and to not share them.\n\nThe problem seems to transcend Emerson. One out of every five college students in America have abused the drug, according to estimates by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Just yesterday, five Columbia University students were arrested for dealing drugs out of their fraternity house on campus, according to CBS news. Among the drugs seized by police was Adderall.\n\nDr. John Sargent, the chief of child psychiatry at Tufts Medical Center, said while the drug is akin to other illegal substances and has harmful side effects, it does provide what students want: extra energy.\n\n“It’s a stimulant,” Sargent said. “It is in the same class of drugs as methamphetamine, which is speed, and it is just as addictive. But there’s no question that it focuses concentration, somebody might abuse it to get high and some might use it to stay up at night.”\n\nFor Brian, the jolt was nearly instantaneous. Two hours after taking the pill and slumping into the lumpy, red couch in the sixth floor common room, his paper was finished.\n\n“It had an extreme effect,” the sophomore said. “I became really happy, I was writing and getting things done. In a video game sense, it’s a power up.” I love this analogy me too, great quote\n\nThe most common way for students without ADHD to get the drug is for those who have a prescription to sell the leftovers.\n\nAn Emerson sophomore and self-described Adderall dealer said she sells about 20 pills out of the 30 she receives each month from her prescription.\n\nThe marketing major said she regularly deals 20 milligram extended release capsules to about seven students, but that there are other pill peddlers on campus who sell to 20, or even 30 people.\n\n“I dealt a little bit in high school with friends,” the marketing major said. “Then I got to college, and it was like a boom here.”\n\nMost pills sell for around $5 to $10 a piece, the dealer said. Some suppliers sell larger, 64-milligram pills, which can command a higher price.\n\nMany students who consume the drug, she said, simply swallow it. But some crush and snort it for a more immediate, intense effect.\n\nSargent said snorting the drug will make it enter the bloodstream quicker, but cautioned against the side effects of the drug, which can include increased heart rate, long-term damage to one’s body, and decreased sleep and appetite. One report from the online ADHD help center said it can, in rare cases, result in sudden death syndrome.\n\n“It’s pretty clear that it’s commonly abused,” Sargent said. “I think it’s a problem because the person who’s diverting it [the dealer] is causing problems.”\n\nOver four million children are prescribed Adderall each year in the United States, a CBS News report said. The drug stimulates chemical in the brain that control attentiveness, which help ADHD patients focus, Sargent said.\n\nBut when abused on college campuses, it’s an easy way to cram.\n\n“It’s a pretty common method,” the dealer said. “I don’t think people want to be taking drugs, but there’s such pressure coming from everyone. Mediocrity isn’t that accepted anymore. You have to stand out.”\n\nPowers had a similar take, saying she is not surprised by the prescription drug abuse on campus.\n\n“Emerson is an extremely competitive environment and there is a great deal of anxiety and stress concerning academic performance,” Powers said. “Some students may feel the \"need\" to use these medications in order to do well and because these are \"legal prescription drugs\" they may be perceived to be \"safe\" to use.”\n\nThat was the motivation for one sophomore digital post production major who popped two 64-milligram Adderalls 12 hours apart. The tiny blue pills kept her awake for 40 hours.\n\n“I was a little jittery,” she said. “People asked me if I was sick. I guess I looked strung out, but I wasn’t. I felt great.”\n\nSargent said the effects of becoming addictive could shorten one’s lifespan.\n\n“It’s what could happen to ‘speedfreaks’ who are using a lot of methamphetamine,” Sargent said. “They just age faster. You’re burning up calories with no fuel. It’s a big problem.”\n\nBottom line, one sophomore theater studies major said, Adderall provides many college students with what they want: a quick and easy shot of adrenaline.\n\n“Part of me feels like it’s a modern-day, enhanced version of speed,” he said. “Just less dangerous.”","dt":"2010-12-09 04:45:34 -0800"},"130":{"terms":[{"id":20,"name":"Berkeley Beacon"},{"id":24,"name":"cage"},{"id":25,"name":"cage free eggs"},{"id":32,"name":"chickens"},{"id":38,"name":"David Colman-Hidy"},{"id":41,"name":"eggs"},{"id":45,"name":"Emerson College"},{"id":70,"name":"Morgan St. John"},{"id":104,"name":"writing"},{"id":6,"name":"News"}],"title":"1,400 call for cage-free","body":"<strong>Heidi Moeller, Beacon Staff</strong><em>\n</em>\n\nWhen alumnus David Colman-Hidy started asking students to petition for cage-free eggs in Emerson’s dining halls last October, he expected that, with enough support, the college would ban battery cage eggs by the start of the spring semester.\n\nMore than three months and 1,400 student signatures later, cafeteria cooks still default to battery cage eggs from factory farms that cramp hens into cages smaller than a sheet of letter-sized paper.\n\nOne day before Colman-Hidy was scheduled to meet with Aramark and submit the petition, he said the college deferred his appeal to boot battery cage eggs by offering cage-free eggs on request. Aramark then canceled the meeting, he said.\n\n“What’s become so grievous is not the cage-free issue, it’s now more of an unresponsive administration,” said Colman-Hidy, who graduated with a degree in political communication last year. “It’s the fact that they are not responding to the overwhelming support and willingness of cost from students.”\n\nBattery cage farms confine chickens to overcrowded cages that prevent them from nesting or spreading their wings, according to the Humane Society website. Factory farms that produce cage-free eggs raise the birds on open floor space.\n\nAndrew Tiedemann, vice president of public affairs, said the college cannot negotiate terms with Aramark to stock exclusively cage-free eggs until their current contract expires in June. But he said 240 of the 1,800 eggs served to students between November and December were cage-free.\n\nHowever, dismayed by the college’s heedless response, Chris Girard, a fellow 2010 alum, started a Facebook event last month titled “TELL EMERSON COLLEGE: respect student opinion and prevent animal cruelty!” The event had 69 members as of Wednesday night.\n\nGirard, a former editor at the Beacon, said he spurred more than 100 alums to write, e-mail, and call institutional advancement, which oversees alumni donations, stating they will not donate money to the school until the dining hall is completely rid of battery cage eggs.\n\n“It’s very important that the Emerson administration listen to students’ concerns,” Girard said. “I’m puzzled and disheartened that they haven’t taken a strong step.”\n\nTiedemann said he responded to each person who contacted institutional advancement, telling them the college has offered cage-free eggs upon request, and the administration is calculating the increase.\n\n“There are contractual and financial considerations,” Tiedemann said in an interview. “We can not switch until the new academic year because of our contract, and we also have to figure out how much of an increase it would be to the meal plan.”\nColman-Hidy, who is the Boston Campaign Coordinator at The Humane League, has also worked with Bay State College to help them go cage-free.\n\n“It’s kind of a no-brainer issue to me,” Colman-Hidy said. “It is criminal animal cruelty in seven states and anywhere in Europe. [Aramark] is missing the point.”\n\nChris Guinn, a senior journalism major, works for Aramark. He contributed to creating the petition and gathering student signatures. Although he has no longer been collecting student signatures, he said the support from the student body is still present.\n\n“Students still keep asking when cage-free eggs will be in the dining hall,” Guinn said. “These students signed the petition because they wanted their voices to be heard. They are still passionate even though we are dealing with [the administration].”\nThe Student Government Association gave their full support for the cage-free egg initiative in a statement late last November.\n“The Emerson College SGA expects this initiative to be honored in full no later than the beginning of March 2011, and to communicate with the student body regarding its progress toward those ends,” the statement read.\n\nSGA Vice President Tau Zaman said he fully supports the alums’ initiatives.\n\n“I think it’s great that we have alumni who care about the school enough to change things that don’t affect them anymore,” Zaman said. “I hope that undergraduates can find their own level of dissatisfaction and work towards justice.”\n\nZaman also said the fact that Emerson is bound to a contract with its food provider should not be the reason Emerson doesn’t change to cage-free eggs.\n\n“Our contract can say any number of things, and the student body probably wasn’t involved in creating that contract,” Zaman said. “It’s [the college’s] responsibility to address it.”","dt":"2011-01-20 19:51:39 -0800"},"281":{"terms":[{"id":14,"name":"Editorial"}],"title":"Don’t be a chicken Emerson, go cage free.","body":"<h1><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Editorial Staff</span></h1>\nSome of us felt pretty cooped up over break. There isn’t that much to do, your parents want to spend every waking moment watching home videos, and your siblings have taken the family car. Now imagine your family of five living in a box just under nine by nine by nine feet—not just for break, but for your whole life. Those are the dimensions your home would be if you were one of the battery cage hens producing the eggs that make omelets and breakfast sandwiches in Emerson’s dining hall.\n\nNot happy with that information? You are not alone.\n\nOver a third of Emerson’s graduate and undergraduate student body—1,400 students—have signed a petition calling for cage-free eggs in the college’s cafeteria.\n\nUnfortunately this staggering percentage has not inspired much urgency.\n\nAccording to Vice President of Public Affairs Andrew Tiedemann, a negotiation with the school’s food provider Aramark cannot take place until their contract is up for review in June. Until then, students can request cage-free eggs, but the default will not change.\n\nThat’s cracked. And it sounds more like bologna than eggs. The college, as an employer, probably has more leverage than it cares to admit. Other colleges Aramark serves, including Vassar College and the University of Minnesota, no longer purchase battery cage eggs. Should it continue its inaction, little will change in our kitchens this semester. Meanwhile, our college will continue contributing to needless animal suffering.\n\nThe ethics of battery cage eggs is hardly worth discussing. It’s a hideously cruel practice and furthermore a disgusting way to produce something intended for consumption. The whole European Union figured that out back in 2009 and has since banned the practice.\n\nBut perhaps more importantly, this series of events leads us to question whether Emerson takes the concerns of its student body seriously. If contractual barriers are as impenetrable as the college claims, we should at least receive a promise that, come June, changes will be made.\n\nThe good news is we can take a stand now, without the support of the college, much like David Coman-Hidy and Chris Guinn did last semester when they launched their campaign for cage-free eggs. We’re consumers too, after all.\n\nIf you don’t want to support battery cage eggs, don’t.  Ask for cage free eggs when you’re having your breakfast made or opt out of eggs all together. Then tell your friends to do the same. Last semester 240 of the 1,800 eggs served to students between November and December were cage-free.

There was no reason for the players to even suspect such an announcement. After the meeting, the athletic department posted on its website that the coach of 16 years had “decided to leave the College to pursue other interests.”\n\nBut the players in the locker room that day tell a different story. Junior Carlos Negrete said Nance explained to the team that, “People higher up in the school are looking to go in a different direction.”\n\nLater, William P. Gilligan, the vice president of information technology who oversees athletics for President Jacqueline Liebergott, told a Beacon reporter that the decision to “no longer have” Mr. Smith as the coach was made by the College.\n\nSo far, neither administrators in the athletics department nor those in President Liebergott’s office have provided any explanation for the coach’s sudden removal.  Nor have they explained why the language on the Emerson site conflicts with the story they tell in person.\n\nWhat we do know is that both players and alumni of the Emerson men’s basketball team are flabbergasted. Coach Smith, by all accounts that the Beacon can gather, was a beloved — even iconic — member of the Emerson community and a tremendous coach.\n\nAlumni from across the country have contacted the Beacon to express their outrage. Each describes a heartwarming mentor and friend. In a school renowned for revolving doors of adjunct professors, shifting academic advisors and transient housing placements, Smith was one of the few stable figures available to students. This, in addition to 258 career victories and a spot in the Great Northeast Athletic Conference finals 10 out of 16 years, leads us to believe that Smith was — at very least — very good at his job.\n\nWith so many testimonials in support of Smith and so few answers from the College, we at the Beacon have been forced by the College’s silence to question its decision to remove him.\n\nAnd amid all of the controversy only one thing is clear to us at the Beacon: The method in which the College handled this situation is deplorable. To deny students — especially the players of the men’s basketball team — an earnest explanation of its decision is disrespectful.\n\nSmith’s departure is in and of itself traumatic. The men’s basketball team is two thirds of the way through a tough season and is facing the pressure of the oncoming playoff season. Cutting their coach at this date cuts them off at their knees.\n\nBy excusing itself from any justification of their actions, the College has added insult to injury. To state that Smith “decided to leave the College to pursue other interests” only to reveal that the decision was made by administrators is disingenuous and disappointing.\n\nIf Emerson has any confidence in its decision, it should be up-front and direct about the choice it made. The members of this community are entitled to an honest dialogue.\n\nUntil then, we students should show we care.\n\nLet’s rally behind our basketball team. Show up to their next game, this  Saturday at 3 p.m. Not very many of us play sports at the collegiate level, so perhaps we cannot fully understand the pain and confusion that our players are experiencing. Still, all of us have at one time or another had a life-changing mentor — surely we can empathize on that level.\n\nAnd to the members of the men’s basketball team: Do not be afraid to demand answers. Your confusion is not yours alone. Your teammates, fellow Lions, former basketball players spanning nearly 20 years, and this editorial board are here to support you.\n\n</div>\n&nbsp;","dt":"2011-01-27 23:03:01 -0800"},"292":{"terms":[{"id":7,"name":"Opinion"}],"title":"Obama’s Supporters need to revive their vigor","body":"<h1><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-size: 13px;\"><strong>John Keane, Beacon Staff</strong></span></h1>\n“At 11 p.m., the wild rumpus began on Boylston Street as Emerson residence halls spewed forth throngs of students who marched down the street toward Copley Square.”\nEmily Carroll wrote those words in the Beacon on Nov. 6, 2008, two days after President Obama’s election. People were electrified. Students  — those apathetic Americans whom pundits believed to be more sluggish than civic  — voted in hordes. A few weeks later, Obama announced in his inaugural address that he would usher in “a new era of responsibility.” It felt as though we were witnessing history in real time. And we were. Walking down Boylston street  — I kid you not  — a Boston local actually wished me a good afternoon.\n\nLast Friday marked the anniversary of Obama’s inauguration, the halfway mark in his historic term. Despite all his accomplishments, one can’t help but notice: For many of those who went crazy back in 2008, the wind has left our sails.\n\nAccording to a recent Gallup poll, 49 percent of Americans approve of the job he is doing. President Obama’s first two years boasted the biggest budget deficits, measured as a share of national GDP, since World War II. According to the New York Times, unemployment remains around 10 percent, 16 percent for individuals between the ages of 15 and 24. Our transportation infrastructure is in desperate need of repair, and the Programme for International Student Assessment recently rated our education system at 18th in the world, between Iceland and Lichtenstein. Guantanamo is still open. And we’re still at war. Considering the challenges we still face, it’s not surprising Americans are dissatisfied with their President.\n\nBut it is disappointing. According to Bloomberg, Obama’s administration presided over the most productive Congress since the 1960’s. It passed both health care reform that is expected to cover 32 million uninsured Americans and a nuclear arms reduction treaty with Russia that the State Department says will reduce the number of warheads deployed by each country from 6,000 to 3,050. It regulated credit card companies such that they can no longer bill you for overcharging your credit card. The list goes on. Are Americans unaware of these achievements, or simply uninterested?\n\nObama’s midterm ‘shellacking’ may be evidence for the latter. The day after last November’s election, the President offered what I think is still the most compelling diagnosis of what has ailed his administration thus far. “One of the reasons I think people were excited during the campaign was the prospect of changing how business is done in Washington,” Obama said from the White House Press Room. “We were in such a hurry to get things done, we didn’t change how things got done.”\n\nThough I share the disappointment felt by some of those who voted for Obama in 2008, I think their disillusionment is a sign of fatigue, and that their blame is misplaced.\nWe should not fault Obama for failing to bring fundamental change to way Washington works. We should fault Washington.\n\nOur political class knew as well as we did the postpartisan era we envisioned on Nov. 4, 2008. Even though that dream was conceived en masse, we stupidly thought it could be achieved by one person. This task should have been entrusted to every elected official or, better still, every citizen. My disappointment is not with Obama. I’m disappointed with us.  We expected our President, after doing all in his power to pull a nation back from the brink of economic collapse, to also achieve what is uniquely in our power  — to bring fundamental change to politics.\n\nIn 2008, Obama helped us articulate a dream. Two years in, he has already proven himself an accomplished President. But to solve the problems we face, he will need more support than we have given him during the first half of his term. The changes you wish to see will not transpire without you. If, over the past two years, your dreams have turned to dust  — vacuum.\n\n&nbsp;","dt":"2011-01-27 23:32:51 -0800"},"312":{"terms":[{"id":6,"name":"News"},{"id":8,"name":"SGA Briefs"}],"title":"SGA grants publisher’s appeal","body":"<!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 15.0px Arial} p.p2 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 16.0px Times; min-height: 19.0px} --><strong>Heidi Moeller, Beacon Staff</strong>\n\nThe Undergraduate Students for Publishing appealed for $825.74 at the Student Government Association joint session meeting Tuesday, but because of ambiguous wording in the appeals packet, they will not receive any money until they have completed fundraising.\n\nBrittany Perro, class of 2011 president, questioned whether SGA could allocate the full amount because the organization has yet to raise funds. The SGA requires groups to independently raise 10 percent of their budgets before appealing to the joint session. However, Vice Treasurer Corey Starbuck said this has not yet been made clear in the appeal packets, and he did not have time to review it with the Undergraduate Students for Publishing before the appeal.\n\nVice President Tau Zaman said he blamed the SGA for the unclear wording in the appeal packet’s fundraising clause and supported granting the money.\n\n“I think we should still pass because this whole time we led them to believe that they were going to have a successful appeal,” the sophomore political communications major said. “This is something that SGA should handle on their own time, and not make another organization suffer for it.”\n\nEthan Silverstein, class of 2012 senator, highlighted that <em>em Magazine</em> appealled last semester where the SGA allocated $10,000 to the magazine when it had not raised any money.\n\n“It was brought up that the fundraising was questionable because it hasn’t happened yet. In the <em>em Mag</em> appeal there was questionable fundraising, and we allocated twice this amount for them to fix typos,” Silverstein said.\n\nMarisa LaFleur, president of the publishing group, said they plan on fundraising $100 through a series of “genre day” events in the coming months. At these events, the club will choose a popular book genre to promote and charge students a small fee to attend. For example, she said, they plan to host a romance themed event in February.\n\nStarbuck, who is taking over the duties of treasurer until a replacement is nominated, suggested that the funds be held until the undergraduate students for publishing raise the $100. Zaman made a motion on Starbuck’s recommendation and all SGA members voted yes to allocating $825.74 once they present their fundraising efforts.","dt":"2011-01-27 00:48:44 -0800"},"313":{"terms":[{"id":6,"name":"News"}],"title":"Juniors now required to dorm","body":"<!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 15.0px Arial} p.p2 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 16.0px Times; min-height: 19.0px} --><strong>Rebecca Isenhart, Beacon Correspondent</strong>\n\nLandlords in Central Square and Allston may notice a little dip in their pool of prospective tenants.  Amanda Turnley, housing operations coordinator, announced that on campus housing will now be a requirement for rising juniors at an information session on Tuesday.\n\nRising juniors can apply to be removed from on-campus housing through the reverse housing application. Turnley said a lottery system will be used to determine which applicants can move off-campus. The number of accepted reverse housing applications depends on the number of combined incoming freshmen, rising sophomores, and wait-listed students not covered by residency requirement.\n\nAccording to Turnly, rising juniors can now submit paper-only forms, available in the Office of Housing and Residence Life, due by Feb. 11.\n\nTurnley said students seeking to move off campus for medical or financial reasons, or because they are 21 or over do not have to apply for reverse housing. Instead, those students should contact OHRL.\n\nMatt Noel, sophomore performing arts major, is among those hoping to move off-campus next semester. If his reverse housing application is approved, Noel said he looks forward to an apartment in Back Bay or Central where he can be more independent from the Emerson campus.\n\n“I feel like I’ve been on campus long enough,” he said.\n\nTurnley also announced the housing selection process will now be taking place through ECMobile. All current freshmen and sophomores are required to apply for housing. Those who do not submit a housing contract will not receive a lottery number, but will instead be assigned to a room after the housing selection process is complete.\n\nWhen applying, students have the option to designate interest in a learning community, gender-neutral housing, or request specific roommates or suitemates. Students who are uninterested in any of those options and want to participate in open-room selection still have to fill out the online form, because the necessary housing contract is attached.\n\nTurnley said she is confident the switch to online applications will make the process smoother and more convenient. The Northeastern University and Boston University housing selections are done online.\n\n“There’s a lot of research out there that this system does work,” said Turnley. “Hopefully it will do well here.”\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;","dt":"2011-01-27 00:49:42 -0800"},"314":{"terms":[{"id":6,"name":"News"}],"title":"SGA to liaison student complaints with business services","body":"<!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 15.0px Arial} p.p2 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 16.0px Times; min-height: 19.0px} --><strong>Heidi Moeller, Beacon Staff</strong>\n\nOn a given night in the dining hall, Lindsey Train, a vegetarian, might go to the grill and order a veggie burger. Her burger, she said, is typically cooked right next to a regular hamburger patty, and she watches the juices from the hamburger soak into her meat-free patty. After seeing that, Train doesn’t even want to eat.\n\n“I have tried to get in touch with dining services before, but never heard anything back,” the freshman journalism major, said.\n\nTrain is not alone in her complaint. Cami Bravo, Student Government Association president, said she and other SGA members have received numerous complaints about issues surrounding business services, particularly Aramark, Emerson’s food provider.\n\n“The main concerns are the fact that they don’t label their food. Students have had instances where they ask the workers what’s in their food and the workers don’t even know. It’s just worrisome for people who have allergies, people who have a dietary restriction like vegetarians, vegans, etc,” Bravo said.\n\nAnother problem has been the grill and the legrain and legume sections of the dining hall, Bravo said. At the grill, students have witnessed workers using the same spatula to flip a grilled cheese sandwich as a raw hamburger, which not only is a concern to vegans and vegetarians, but a health issue. Bravo said vegans have also been distraught by the fact that the legrain and legume section of the dining hall is not open on the weekends, leaving them with just the salad bar.\n\nAccording to Bravo, the Student Government Association said it plans to work closely with the business services office this semester to address various complaints they have heard from students. By creating a Facebook page devoted to the issues surrounding business services such as the food served by Aramark, the bookstore, laundry centers, print and copy center, and the convenience store, SGA president Cami Bravo said she hopes to allow more student voices to be heard.\n\n“We want to make sure that it’s not just SGA concerns. A lot of the stuff we’ve heard about are from friends or from people who aren’t on SGA, so that’s why we created the business services facebook page,” the junior marketing major said. “But right now, our biggest issue is getting the word out about this page and making sure students are using it.”\n\nRepresentatives from the business services office spoke with members of SGA last semester to answer questions they had, primarily regarding food in the dining hall. This was the first time anyone from business services had been invited to attend an SGA joint session meeting. Andrew Mahoney, director of business services, said while his office has tried to reach out to SGA in the past, it was never a successful relationship.\n\n“They provide an awful lot of insight and energy,” Mahoney said. “It’s easier for us to give people what they want if we know what they want. We come to work here trying to do the best we can, we don’t come here to try and aggravate people.”\n\nThe business services office oversees all of Emerson’s dining services and administers its contract. According to Mahoney, they mostly rely on comment cards and e-mail to receive feedback from students. As mentioned by Bravo, students would like to see food labels at all stations in the dining hall. Mahoney said they are currently working on this issue.\n\n“I would say within the month there should be some additional improvement to signage,” Mahoney said. “We are aware of this and we are trying to move expeditiously on this. It’s an important request and we intend to honor it.”\n\nThe SGA is currently looking for a student to assist  representing the business services office. The representative would attend the meetings held every Wednesday at 11 a.m. in the conference room on the fourth floor of Walker building. They would also work as a liaison between the student body and the administration. Currently, Ashley Brow, communications disorders senator, is a representative, but due to problems with her availability the SGA is looking for a second student to help.\n\n“We are really excited about the prospect of dealing with a representative from SGA that speaks to the student body to get a better sense of what the students are looking for and requiring from us,” Mahoney said.\n\n&nbsp;","dt":"2011-01-27 00:50:58 -0800"},"315":{"terms":[{"id":6,"name":"News"}],"title":"Class of 2012 pres resigns, SGA approves","body":"<!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 15.0px Arial} p.p2 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 16.0px Times; min-height: 19.0px} --><strong>Heidi Moeller, Beacon staff</strong>\n\nMichael Callahan, class of 2012 president, has officially resigned from the position and is currently seeking a replacement.\n\nCallahan, who made Student Government Association members aware of his resignation last semester, has left the position because his class schedule coincides with SGA joint session meetings, which all members are required to attend.\n\nIn a statement to the SGA, Callahan said until a replacement is found, he and class of 2012 vice president Amy Davidson will be ensuring that class council meetings are still held and active.

He said the hardware negates the need for  a crew of six to 12.\n\n“The current system has far greater technology than that of our previous system,” MacArthur said. “Before, the shows never got to the same level as they do now, because each day we’d have to train a new group of people on all of the technical positions.”\n\nKyed said there are still several more phases involved in getting the control and news room up to date.\n\n“We still need to put in a new server for the editing system, as well as new interfaces,” he said. “The entire process of upgrades will take two to three years to complete.”\n\nMacArthur said students and faculty are already noticing an improvement in the quality of shows, as they are now able to do much more than they previously could.\n\n“Our crowning achievement with the system came with WEBN’s live election coverage,” said MacArthur. “[The show] went far more smoothly than ever before, which is a large testament to not only the students but also the new technology.”\n\nAccording to junior Stephanie Greenland, who works as director of WEBN and the journalism channel, the new system has far fewer limitations, providing them with the technology to create a much more sophisticated production, such as allowing them to show back to back graphics, like those CNN premiered during 2010’s mid-term elections.\n\n“This new system is definitely worth it,” the broadcast journalism major said. “This is the kind of system we’ll be coming into contact with after graduation.”\n\nAccording to MacArthur, there are no foreseeable rebuilds for at least another seven to 10 years. However, with the ever-developing industry, staying on top of technology is somewhat of a necessity.\n\n“As soon as you install anything, its out of date within a year. That’s the challenge in not only a broadcast industry but an educational institution as well.”\n\n&nbsp;","dt":"2011-01-27 00:53:47 -0800"},"318":{"terms":[{"id":6,"name":"News"}],"title":"Despite minority increase, diversity still a concern","body":"<!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 15.0px Arial} p.p2 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 16.0px Times; min-height: 19.0px} --><strong>Caitlin Collins, Beacon Staff</strong>\n\nGwendolyn Bates, the associate vice president of diversity and inclusion, said diversity is still a problem at Emerson College, despite a recent a spike in  minority students.\n\nSpeaking at a Martin Luther King, Jr. luncheon last Thursday, Bates said the number of minority students at the college is a poor reflection of diversity in the academic world.\n\n“We have to prepare students to be in a world that’s going to have a large percentage of diverse people,” she said in an interview.\n\nTikesha Morgan, director of multicultural student affairs, said the luncheon celebrated the civil rights leader’s birthday and drew attention to the college’s continued effort to diversify its students and faculty.\n\nMorgan said the population of minority students has increased significantly in recent years.

Otherwise, save swimming for the summer child.\n<strong>3. </strong>Yes, those are the Knicks. Danilo Gallinari checking himself out in the Piano Row windows? Ronny Turiaf sauntering down Boylston? Don’t freak out if you see a bunch of giants in basketball jerseys pass you on the street: they’re just the NBA champs who practice in our “secret” Bobbi Brown and Steven Plofker Gym located on the lower level of Piano Row.\n<strong>4. </strong>Trick or Treats are for Hungry College Kids. If you thought you were too old for trick-or-treating, think again — the houses on Beacon Hill give out king-size candy bars. Just make it to next semester and you can pitch that Energy Bill you wrote up in your spare time to John Kerry personally! Or avoid a foot-in-mouth moment by chewing it over with a king-size Twix.\n<strong>5.</strong> Beware of Windy Corner. Do yourself a favor and bundle up extra warm if you’re planning on voyaging to Ansin. Also, if you have a need to head south from that corner, you can stay out of the wind by cutting through the Little Building from the Tremont exit, placing you next to the Cutler Majestic.\n<strong>6.</strong> New York Pizza is open late. At least later than most Boston food joints. NYP is open until 2 a.m. on weekends and 1 a.m. on weeknights, but after 11 p.m. their by-the-slice options are limited to only cheese or pepperoni. This late-night heaven is located right past 216 Tremont.\n<strong>7.</strong> We don’t have math classes but we have Mike Brown. Professor Brown is quite possibly the most famous of Emerson professors when it comes to the scary factor. He is tough. He requires work. But every student who has taken a “Mike Brown Class” sings his praises until graduation day and beyond. Make it a point to take a class with him even if it costs you an elective. Don’t let him <em>see</em> you cry…\n<strong>8.</strong> ECCash is now accepted at the nearest CVS, Boloco, Sandella’s Flatbread Cafe, Crazy Dough’s Pizza, Lambert’s Market, and Sal’s Pizza.\n<strong>9. </strong>There are pianos in Piano Row. Not only is it  the building located next to a piano store, but on the lower level of this residence hall, there are a number of student offices (among them the <em>Beacon</em>’s) and soundproof rehearsal spaces, some of which feature pianos. Finally, you can practice that annoying, er, traditional bagpipe you’ve been driving your roommate bonkers with.\n<strong>10.</strong> The ProArts Consortium is cool. Chances are you’ve heard about the “Will and Grace” set located in our Iwasaki Library, and at some point during the semester, you may curse that set for taking up valuable space which could have contained the book you needed. Worry not! Emerson is part of the ProArts Consortium — which you should check out not only if you’re interested in taking classes at MassART or Berkeley College of Music, but also because it gives us access to Suffolk University’s library just up Tremont. Grab a book from there and then savor that lovely space we revere.\n\n&nbsp;","dt":"2011-01-20 02:07:49 -0800"},"331":{"terms":[{"id":5,"name":"Lifestyle"}],"title":"SCRUMPTIOUS COFFEE CAKE  ","body":"<h1><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-size: 13px;\"><strong>Jamie Bogert, Beacon Staff</strong></span></h1>\n<div>\n\nOne 9-inch square coffee cake.\nAll ingredients at room temperature.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees\nGrease a 9 in. square baking pan\n\n<em>Whisk together thoroughly:</em>\n\n1 ½ cups all-purpose flour\n1 cup sugar\n2 teaspoons baking power\n½ teaspoon baking soda\n¼ teaspoon salt\n\n<em>In a large bowl, beat well the following:</em>\n\n1 cup sour cream (Sounds crazy, but we’re serious!

Though their selection of hot beverages isn’t as elaborate as that of your favorite chain coffee company, their one-of-a-kind food, desserts, and atmosphere will make your yummy-sensors tingle.\nThe downtown cafe is the only one in Boston exclusively brewing Stumptown Coffee, named The Best Coffee in the World by NPR, The New York Times, Food &amp; Wine Magazine and USA Today, according to the Thinking Cup website. They also offer a variety of organic teas beyond just shoving a tea bag in boiling water.\n\n“I loved that the tea comes in little tea pots and you pour it into little tea cups,” Shea Gomez, a freshman musical theatre major, said. “They don’t use tea bags and it’s really fresh and cute.”\n\nThe Thinking Cup’s owner, Hugh Geiger, went to New England School of Law in the mid-90s and knows the Downtown area well.\n“I thought that a cozy coffee shop would do well. We came up with the name, ‘Thinking Cup’  because we thought that it would be a good idea to come up with a concept that provokes thought,” Geiger said in an e-mail to the Beacon. All the buzz is duly deserved, as their silky smooth brew is the milk and honey of coffees.\n\nUnfortunately for every foodie on a meal plan, your parents can’t fund your inevitable Stumptown Coffee addiction as the Thinking Cup does not accept ECCash yet. Geiger said in an e-mail to the Beacon that they wanted to but Emerson did not permit it. “As it relates to ECCash, we were denied access.  I find it interesting.  I assume we are a threat to the cafe that you guys have,” Geiger said. Hold off on donning your picketing gear, though. According to Andrew Mahoney, Director of Business Services’ e-mail to the Beacon, the matter is still under consideration.\n\n<em>*Food:</em>\nClassic sandwiches like peppercorn turkey and smoked salmon can quash any famine and cost between seven and 10 dollars. For those looking for a lighter alternative, or perhaps reminiscing about European portion sizes, a 6-inch baguette stuffed with tuna or turkey and cheese costs less than five dollars.\n\nAll fans of Panera’s broccoli cheddar should prepare to be blown away by Thinking Cup’s tomato cheddar. The 12-ounce serving for five bucks is more than enough to feel full, but when combined with one of their cheddar and bacon breakfast scones it’s an ultimate cure for those winter chills.\n\n<em>*Desserts:</em>\nFinally, Finale has met its match. Delicate biscotti, fresh fruit tarts in a light custard, exquisite chocolate mousse, buttery coconut macaroons, cupcakes in all shades of frosting and a variety of sizes, and cakes by the slice that will make even the most devout weight watcher throw away the calorie counter. These goodies range in prices from a little over a dollar to five depending on the item.\n\n<em>*Atmosphere:</em>\nThe Thinking Cup’s interior provides the best of both worlds for those looking for a quiet place to read or study and a relaxed atmosphere to spend some time with friends. It’s not the best place to answer e-mails however, as there is no WiFi.\n“I immediately felt like I was in the country,” James Harness, sophomore broadcast journalism major said. “It was like a hybrid between a country bakery and a city cafe.”\n\nThe decoration of the cafe combines intimate lighting imperative to providing that relaxing anonymity previously reserved exclusively for romantic restaurants with unrefined details like one brick wall and chalkboard menus. Each tabletop displays a different vintage newspaper local to Boston behind a thick glass. One is the front page of the July 22, 1969 Boston Herald Traveler covering Neil A. Armstrong and Edwin E. Aldrin Jr.’s return from their lunar landing, while another is the morning edition of the Boston Sunday Globe from February 16, 1896 featuring a “Pictorial History of a Century of Cycling.” The rest of the decor consists of delicious goodies in glass cases and jars.\n\nSheel Ganatra, a grad student at MIT and a coffee aficionado, finds himself a regular here.\n\n“I keep coming back because I consistently find it very good. Good coffee, good location, and good hours ,which is rare in the Boston area to say the least,” Ganatra said. And it’s true! The Thinking Cup is open as late as 10 p.m. Monday — Thursday and until 11 p.m. Friday — Sunday. Between its accommodating hours and proximity to campus, it’ll be hard not to find yourself going back.\n\n&nbsp;","dt":"2011-01-27 02:10:14 -0800"},"346":{"terms":[{"id":12,"name":"Auntie Em"},{"id":5,"name":"Lifestyle"}],"title":"Anal Gratification","body":"<div>Dear Auntie Em,I’m a male at Emerson who has only ever been with females and thoroughly enjoys sex with them.

He has it nice. He can’t even appreciate what he has.\n\nSo, with that, I’ve got a message for all the Patriots fans that for some reason can’t be happy with their freakin’ 99: watch the Super Bowl.\n\nI know your beloved gridiron pantheons weren’t as successful this season as you hoped for, but that should not inhibit you from watching what is shaping up to be one of the best sporting spectacles in recent memory.\n\nThere are too many subplots and intriguing storylines to tune out and watch whatever re-runs competing networks might peddle that night.\n\nFrom a stylistic standpoint, this game will be unlike any Super Bowl played since the early 90s. Back when Lawrence Taylor was flying around the field on one side, and Darryl Talley, Shane Conlan, and Cornelius Bennett (the three AFC Pro Bowl linebackers) were on the other — also known as Super Bowl XXV.\n\nThis Super Bowl, like the aforementioned New York Giants vs. Buffalo Bills contest of 1991, features two smashmouth, dynamic defenses that play in your face, loud, abrasive football. Simply put, they play football the right way.\n\nThe saying goes, “defense wins championships.” Well, these two teams boast championship caliber defenses, with the Steelers and Packers allowing the fewest and second fewest points respectively, this season in the NFL. Get ready for a doozy.\n\nThere is no shortage of big names on the defensive side of the ball, either. Guys like Clay, Hawk, Farrior, and Woodson, the kind of names you would only normally hear on Ben Stiller’s dodge ball team.\n\nThis matchup features the classic battle of the, veteran “been there — done that” quarterback in Ben Roethlisberger versus the “up-and-comer” Aaron Rodgers.\n\nRodgers, the quarterback who replaced Brett Favre in 2008,  has finally taken the Pack to football’s grandest stage. By comparison, it took Favre four years to reach the Super Bowl (and 16 years to expose his genatalia via text), while Rodgers reached the big game in just three years (and has yet to bare all by his phone). A Super Bowl win for A-Rodge could mean permanently coming out of Favre’s football shadow, and garnering the respect he deserves.\n\nLet’s not forget: the last time the Packers won the Super Bowl was 1997, and they came just one win short of another Lombardi trophy the following year in 1998, long before iPhones and ‘sexting’ were even invented. Green Bay is craving a title.\n\nAnd for history’s sake, let’s not forget who the Pack defeated in 1997… those Bill Parcells-led Pats.\n\nPittsburgh, on the other hand, has enjoyed immense success as of late. Winning Super Bowls in 2005 and 2008, the Steelers are the second most successful team in recent memory behind… ahem, your Foxborough gods.\n\nThis is a rare opportunity for the football fanatics of the Commonwealth to watch a game in January/February objectively, which can lead to more enjoyment. Just think; you don’t have to hold your breath every time Brady’s Beiber-cut gets ruffled, or when Belichick decides to go for it on fourth down from his own five yardline.\n\nTake it from a New York Giants fan: watching post-season football with no vested interest can potentially open up a world of viewing enjoyment.\n\nUnfortunately, this game will be played in the comfort of Cowboys Stadium, in the good ol’ Longhorn state. A snowy backdrop could have turned this insta-classic into an all-timer, but we’ll have to make do.\n\nMaybe you are still  depressed, and have not left your room since that dreadful Sunday. Maybe some of you are reading this from the sanctity of the rock you’re hiding under until the NFL season kicks off next September. But if you consider yourself a football fan, this is a game you’re not going to want to miss.

But head coach Bill Gould suggested it was much more, a sign the Lions were finally pulling out of an early season slump.\n\n“We’re gaining confidence,” Gould said. “It didn’t matter who we were losing to. If we played the [Los Angeles] Lakers 30 times and went 0-30, we’d still be discouraged. But now we’re winning.”\n\nThe Lions season began with three matchups versus Top 25 Division 3 womens teams. However, after that tough stretch, Emerson’s schedule decreased in difficulty, including a recent conference stretch.\n\nThe Johnson and Wales win was the Lions’ fourth in its last four GNAC matchups, catapulting the team into a third place tie in the GNAC with Norwich University, and one game behind conference leaders Emmanuel College.\n\nWith only six conference games remaining on the Lions schedule, the team is in the thick of a tight race for the top spot in the conference.\n“We moved the ball really well today,” Gould said, whose team dished out 18 assists on 25 field goals.\n\nThe Lions dominated in every facet of the game, scoring on the fast break, in the low post, and off perimeter shots.\n\n“[Johnson and Wales] is a team that likes to get back and set up on defense,” said Gould, who urged his team to run the fast break many times throughout the first half following defensive rebounds.\n\nWhen the buzzer sounded and the first half was over, consecutive three-pointers in the last 30 seconds by Amy Sherman, and Shannon Norton (at the buzzer) extended Emerson’s lead to 16, its largest of the half.\n\nJohnson and Wales didn’t show any signs of life as the second half began, and an energized Emerson squad took full advantage stretching the lead to 31 before the game ended.\n\n“The message was still the same before the game,” said Gould. “It’s not who we’re playing; it’s what we’re playing.”\n\nAs Emerson continues to reel in the victories, players have noticed a boost in morale in the locker room.\n\n“Hopefully we can carry this confidence into games against better conference teams,” said DiNucci, who rang in a game- high 23 points, including seven three-pointers.\n\n“They were running a zone which is just asking a shooter to shoot,” said DiNucci, who had many wide-open looks throughout the second half with no defenders in sight. “I practice shooting without getting guarded, so I guess I have no excuse.”\n\nAnd while Emerson controlled the game behind DiNucci’s efforts, it was a well-rounded Emerson attack that proved to be too much for the Wildcats.\n\nKathy Andrade contributed yet another double-double with 20 points and 10 rebounds, and Shannon Norton continued to impress her coach coming off the bench to tally 16 points, and lead the Lions in minutes played at 31.\n\n“Shannon Norton stepped up,” said Gould. “I hate to say it, but you expect those games from DiNucci and Kathy. They’re great players.”","dt":"2011-02-03 00:51:18 -0800"},"172":{"terms":[{"id":9,"name":"Sports"}],"title":"Lions’ shortest player aims high in new position","body":"<strong>Catey Stahl, Beacon Correspondent</strong>\n\nNext time you come out for an Emerson women’s basketball game, look for jersey number four. Pink laces accenting purple Nikes and hair straightened to perfection make Emerson’s new point guard stand out.\n\nThe sophomore from Toronto, Ontario plays basketball. In a land usually dominated by ice hockey, Amy Sherman is an exception.\n“We’re a basketball family,” said Sherman, a sophomore communication studies major. “Most Canadian families are hockey families, but that’s not us.”\n\nAnother thing that sets Sherman apart is her height. She stands at a mere 5-foot-1.\n\n“Being short is completely out of my control, so I just have to deal with it and adjust,” Sherman said. “I feel that it gives me another challenge, and I have to do other things to compensate for that. I just try to be pretty scrappy and into my head thinking-wise rather than the physicality of it.”\n\nSherman has started all 18 games this season for the Lions and is one of the leaders on her team in steals and scoring.\n“She’s the shortest player on our team, but in the game against Salve Regina, by halftime she was leading the team in rebounds,” Madeline Smeaton, a freshman teammate said.\n\nSherman was introduced to athletics at an early age by her father, Doug Sherman.\n“He really introduced me to sports and how they can really positively influence your life and create and install morals and values in you,” Sherman said. “Not only do you become in good shape but what you learn on the court or on the field and take it into your everyday life, that’s what I really want to thank him for.”\nSherman said before her father introduced sports into her life, she had different dreams.\n“I wanted to be a ballerina,” Sherman said. “I would go to ballet class, but I really wasn’t graceful enough to be a ballerina. So then I tried tap dancing because that was a little less graceful and more bouncy, but I wasn’t great at that either. So I gave basketball a shot, and I felt that was more me.”\nIf Sherman was still attempting to grace the stage in pink satin shoes, then the basketball team would be without what head coach Bill Gould describes as a key player on the team. This season, Gould said, she’s been able to switch positions successfully, helping the Lions reshuffle their lineup.\nThe Lions’ point guard from last season, Jackie Williams,  now attends Johns Hopkins University, and Sherman has filled her role.\n“Our old point guard transferred, and Amy is familiar with our system,” Gould said. “She really understands what we are trying to do, and she does a real nice job with that. She’s more of a shooter and can distribute the ball well.”\nSherman is not completely unfamiliar with the point position. She ran the offense at Community Hebrew Academy of Toronto.\n“I played point in high school,” Sherman said. “The adjustment to college level is different, but I enjoy it and I love passing the ball to my teammates and seeing them be successful.”\nIt was Sherman’s hard work ethic in high school that earned her MVP four years in a row and captain for two years. According to Gould, she continues to stand out.\n“It’s kind of a cliché, but very true in this case: she’s a great kid,” Gould said. “A hard worker, and it seeps through to the rest of the team.”\nHer teammates agree. “I look up to her,” Smeaton said. “She’s very serious about her game and dedicated to improving our team. If I don’t know, I look to Amy. If the captain’s not here, I look to Amy.”\nSherman is still positive about grabbing a Great Northeast Athletic Conference championship this year despite the Lions’ young team. The team is currently 7-12 (5-1, GNAC).\nWhile Sherman said she still has a strong work ethic, she credits her father for where she is today.\n“I think parents are really big influences on your lives,” Sherman said. “That fact that my dad didn’t really push me towards sports but instead he opened my eyes to what they are. I don’t think I would have had the same relationship with sports if he didn’t show me.”","dt":"2011-02-03 01:01:50 -0800"},"173":{"terms":[{"id":9,"name":"Sports"}],"title":"College hires new interim men’s basketball coach","body":"<strong>Gabe Souza, Beacon Staff</strong>\n\n<!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 15.0px Arial} -->Last fall, after over 25 years of roaming the sidelines, Lynn Ramage decided to take a break from coaching basketball. The 53-year-old said he wanted to focus on getting his master’s degree in executive leadership and management through an online program at Liberty University, based out of Lynchburg, Va.\n\nBut when he saw a head coaching vacancy for men’s basketball at Emerson last week, he jumped at the opportunity.\n\n“I saw the situation and put in for it,” Ramage said. “I sent my resumé up and offered my services as soon as I could.”\n\nJust two weeks ago, Ramage said he was grilling steaks in the warmth of his Greensboro, N.C. home. Now, while he is admittedly a bit colder, he is excited to be the Lions’ third head coach this season.\n\nThe Lynchburg, Va. native took over for Stan Nance, the associate director of athletics. Nance had coached the previous four games after Hank Smith suddenly departed the head coaching position on Jan. 21.\n\nSmith, a 16-year veteran, guided the team for just over one-half of the season until the college made the decision to no longer have him lead the squad.\n\nRamage, who will continue to work on his degree, has a career college record of 108-121 with time spent at four different schools, according to NCAA records.\n\nHis most successful season came in 1999-00 when he guided Connecticut College to a 19-5 mark and was named the New England Small College Athletic Conference coach of the year.\n\nRamage’s experience ranges from Division 3 schools like Connecticut College to noted Division 1 programs such as Morgan State (1994-95) and University of North Carolina-Greensboro (2002-04).\n\nMost recently Ramage was the head coach of Halifax County High School in South Boston, Va. There, he guided the Comets to an overall record of 33-30, including two 12-win seasons, according to the Gazette-Virginian, a newspaper in the area.\n\nThe coach said the Emerson vacancy was big news.\n\n“People knew about this all the way to California,” Ramage said. “I think this is one of the better jobs in New England. It’s as good as any and better than most. I’ve coached in the NESCAC and this is just as good. I’m just happy to be here.”\n\nRamage said his plan for Emerson basketball is simple.\n\n“I would like to get these seniors to play as many games as we can,” he said. “That’s what we said in the locker room here just a few minutes ago. We would like for you to go out in the best way possible. The kids have been very receptive to me so far, and I really appreciate that.”\n\nPlayers seemed pleased with their new coach.\n\n“I like Lynn right now,” said Bilali Mack, a sophomore animation major. “He’s been motivational for us, telling us to keep our heads up and things like that.”Junior forward Carlos Negrete agreed.\n\n“So far, so good,” said Negrete, a broadcast journalism major. “His practices have been pretty mellow, and it’s definitely nice that he’s trying to support us and he’s understanding the situation.”\n\nBut while early returns on Ramage’s coaching style were positive, the situation proved difficult for many players.\n\n“It’s pretty hard man,” Mack said. “It’s the third coach we’ve had this season. I don’t even know if this has ever happened to any basketball program before. It’s pretty hard; we’re a strong team, and we’ll play hard. But we don’t really know what happened with our coach, and we try to move on and keep it about basketball. Coach Hank [Smith] taught us how to fight.”\n\nSmith’s departure sparked controversy after the college originally said he had left “to pursue other interests.” But just a few days after the statement was released, William P. Gilligan, the vice president of information technology who oversees athletics for President Jacqueline Liebergott, said the college had a hand in his exit, but gave no reason for the decision.\n\nSmith has not been reached for comment.\n\nRamage will guide his new team for the first time tonight in an in-conference matchup at Mount Ida College. Negrete said that while his team is looking forward to the challenge, it will take some getting used to.\n\n“It’s pretty tough, I’ve never gone through a coaching change midseason in my entire life playing basketball, so for it to happen a third time, well, it’s kind of strange,” Negrete said. “It’ll take a lot of getting used to. We are going to have to kind of feel our way through.”\n\nRamage said he’s not going to try to change anything drastically, but rather focus on the system that’s already in place.\n\n“We’ll keep it the way it is,” Ramage said. “Just navigating the ship that’s already in place. If it ain’t broke, why fix it?”\n\n&nbsp;","dt":"2011-02-03 01:05:01 -0800"},"174":{"terms":[{"id":7,"name":"Opinion"}],"title":"Reflecting on Obama’s State of the Union speech","body":"<strong>Sarah Betancourt, <strong>Beacon Contributor</strong></strong>\n\nOn Jan. 20, 2009, President Obama announced a \"new era of responsibility.” It is unfounded and impetuous for anyone to conclude that the past two years have been a letdown for the American people. It is easy for us to acknowledge the failed policies of the eight year Bush administration, and to sweep them under the carpet without recognizing the implications they have had on the current administration. It is even easier to discount success and highlight failure.  No President since the time of FDR has dealt with such conflict and responsibility, and handled it with the ability worthy of the title of Commander-in-Chief.\n\nBy January of 2009, GDP had fallen at the fastest rate in a quarter-century. Seven hundred thousand jobs were being lost each month. According to the budget summary for FYI 2011, the financial crisis of 2008 had let $5,000,000,000,000.00 of Americans’ households' wealth disappear in 3 months as stock values plummeted.This led to record foreclosure rates and declining home values.\n\nObama's most pressing problem is that he has to alleviate the minds of the American people who are misled daily by the bold-faced lies of those in power.\n\nThe GOP wanted to extend the tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans in order to allow the top wage earners to reinvest their money in the economy. While Don’t Ask Don’t Tell and the Dream Act were being \"held hostage\" by the GOP in December, Obama extended his hand in an act of bipartisanship and sacrificed his political clout. He called for the extension of tax cuts for the 2 percent of wealthiest Americans for the good of the other 98 percent who were about to lose enormous funds for programs in health care, education, and small business growth. According to the National Employment Law Project, 2.25 million Americans would have continued to struggle to put food on the table without the extension.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office states that repealing the health care law would worsen the federal deficit over the next 10 years, by $230 billion. Yet, the House Republican leadership misrepresents this CBO report which actually says that the amount of labor used in the economy will decrease by a small amount because of (and here’s the important part) people retiring and cutting back their own hours. The GOP insists that the bill would cut 1.6 million jobs, but falsely cites an employer mandate that is not actually in the bill. This is often misconstrued because Speaker Boehner claims he wants to remove barriers to job growth, as cited in the Pledge to America taken by the GOP. However, how can this be done with a \"job-killing bill,\" that actually perpetuates the very thing it claims to be against?\n\nSo how does President Obama contend to the inaccuracies of the messaging of the GOP, the precarious support of his base who still want more progressive policies, and the weary American public? With a State of the Union speech.\n\nTo assuage the fears of those concerned with the national deficit, Obama proposed a five-year freeze on all discretionary spending. While many Republicans are underwhelmed by this proposal, it is imperative to remember that cutting more would effect our quest to be internationally competitive. We must acknowledge Obama’s proposals in the major cuts in defense spending, the enforcement of the Troubled Asset Relief Program, the abolition of earmarks, and the proposed elimination of billions of taxpayer money given to oil companies. Defense cuts alone will save $400 billion over the next decade. All of these reign in the costs of government spending while holding Congress accountable.\n\nAlthough I do care about the deficit, I care more about the competitiveness of the United States and the jobs that will be created upon the rise of US productivity. In 2010 alone, there was a rise of 10.5 percent in exports of goods and services. Obama is proposing a tax credit for companies that undertake research and has set a goal that 80 percent of the nation's electricity will come from clean energy sources by 2035. In order to attain anything near that goal, we will  need educated engineers. With a lack of able engineers to work in this new field, we must provide incentives toward educating all of those held back by the rising cost of education.\n\nIf we can focus on the President's call to innovation in education, clean energy, and transportation infrastructure, our economy would not only be stable-it would be booming.\n\nThe Republican response to the State of the Union, given by Rep. Paul Ryan, focused on reigning in spending, but offered no plans to create jobs. Instead of putting the money where his mouth is, he touts the \"symbolic\" call for repeal of health care reform (which won't pass in the Senate), while millions in tax payers' money are being wasted for every hour spent in meaningless debate on repealing the health care bill.\n\nConsidering this, the President must walk the fine line of pleasing his base and pleasing the party of \"no.\" As he does, we must weigh the benefits and costs of the polarized philosophies of Democrats and Republicans. Is it best to reign in the costs of sizable but necessary spending at the cost of our innovation? Could the ambitious propositions in energy policy and education re-establish our position as the world superpower and put Americans back to work? I leave these questions for you to decide.","dt":"2011-02-03 01:07:15 -0800"},"175":{"terms":[{"id":7,"name":"Opinion"}],"title":"NFL owners’ foul play","body":"<strong>Wade Fink, Beacon Contributor</strong>\n\nWhat a fitting venue: The royal palace of Jerry Jones’ kingdom, Cowboys stadium, will be the home of Superbowl XLV.  More than 100,000 are expected to pack the stadium on game day.\n\nBut there is one aspect of this year’s Super Bowl that many tend to ignore, and that’s the chance that this stadium could be the burial ground for the sport we love.\n\nAn estimated $9 billion operation could be torn down by Jones and his fellow team owners if an agreement is not reached with the National Football League Players’ Association (NFLPA).  The owners want serious concessions from the 2006 collective bargaining agreement, an agreement the players, perhaps mistakenly, admitted was a “great deal.”  Owners want concessions on an array of issues, most notably an 18-game regular season, a rookie salary cap, and a pay cut in the players’ share of revenue.\n\nIf March 3rd comes and goes without an agreement in place, National Football League (NFL) owners will lock out their employees and endanger next year’s season.\n\nAt stake are thousands of jobs and small businesses across the country.  For many, their very livelihoods are at risk. Bars, restaurants, and other businesses in NFL cities depend heavily on Sundays, as do stadium employees and parking lot operators.\n\nA study released last month by Edgeworth Economics highlights the potential impact of a canceled NFL season.  The study purports that every city with an NFL franchise stands to lose about $160 million in revenue, $5 billion total, and an aggregate of 115,000 jobs. The study was commissioned by the NFLPA.\n\n“They don’t care, and that’s our concern here,” said George Atallah, assistant executive director of external affairs for the NFLPA, in an interview with the Beacon. “They have made no consideration for [the people affected].”\n\nAnd that is the simple truth: The owners do not care about the ramifications of this lockout.  It’s as though we’re all collateral damage, from Peyton Manning to the local busboy at MJ O’Connors. The owners want more money. Period.\n|\nNFL spokesman Greg Aiello calls this study a “fairy tale” on the NFL Labor site.\n\nI invited Mr. Aiello or anyone from the NFL to comment directly to the Beacon. Instead, I was sent an email that linked to an article on the NFL labor website.\n\n“Are you going to support a family on selling parking tickets or beer?” Professor Robert Baade, asked in the NFL article, cited to undercut the validity of Edgeworth’s analysis.\n\nWhat an egregious comment. One cannot be more out of touch.  The answer is yes, Professor, thousands do.  And further, for many, it is a second or third job in an attempt to make ends meet.  For them, it’s not about how to pay for a Tom Brady jersey, it’s how to keep the lights and heat on in their homes.\n\nAnd, in the public discourse that is a constant reminder of how little these owners care about actual people, their response to this study is a fine microcosm. No numbers.  No facts. Just incredibly lazy rhetoric.\n\nThe NFL owners have yet to offer a commensurate study.  But they have, ironically, provided the numbers for Edgeworth’s study.\n“The NFL has yet to acknowledge that this study is derived from economic numbers they present to municipalities for tax subsidies,” Atallah said.\n\nThat’s right. The basis for Edgeworth’s study were the NFL’s own numbers, which were used in various pitches to cities across the country for why tax subsidies, to offset the cost of building new stadiums, would benefit the community economically.  The NFL’s pitch to the cities focused on creating jobs, tax revenue, and, overall, the basic rationale for the city to desire an NFL team and stadium.  That is public record. Now the NFL is ignoring the very facts that they themselves presented. They have been hoisted by their own petard.\nClaiming to be suffering economically, with costs rising and revenues not keeping up, the owners have refused to open their books for analysis. But by simply showing, line-by-line, what their expenses are and what their income is, they would seemingly end the debate.  In past labor negotiations, the National Basketball Association (NBA) owners opened their books to the union. The National Hockey League (NHL) has done so in the past. The precedent is there and yet the owners refuse.\n\n“Were not asking for anything.  We didn’t opt-out of the deal,” Atallah said. “We’ve asked them to share their financial information and they’ve said no.”\n\nSadly, they don’t need public support to lock out the players, cut thousands of jobs, and kill small businesses. The owners have the economic leverage to win this war, as they have horded billions to survive a cancelled season.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t be concerned. The public perception is that this fight is between millionaire players and billionaire owners. It’s not. The owners and players will survive. It is the working stiffs, ordinary Americans that will be affected by the owners bullying tactics. Wasn’t that the reason for unions in the first place?\n\nThe NFL owners don’t care, but I’m angry.  And you should be too.","dt":"2011-02-03 01:12:51 -0800"},"176":{"terms":[{"id":7,"name":"Opinion"}],"title":"We need honest grading","body":"<strong>Richard West, Beacon Contributor</strong>\n\nAs a 26-year teaching veteran, I agree with those who claim that there is a grade inflation problem in academia today. Across the country, many college classrooms are filled with students who know that regardless of participation, they’ll “earn” an A or B if they just make it to the end of the term.\n\nNearly every student at Emerson has completed the College’s Instructor Evaluation Form. While all categories on the form are important to me, each semester, I think item 10 sticks out: “The Instructor presented material at an appropriate level of difficulty.”\n\nThough some may quibble about the weight I place on this category, this evaluative item best reflects student perceptions of classroom rigor. As I look at the responses to this category from last fall (62.5% of my students rated me “in the middle”), and as I review my final grade distribution, I wonder if I challenged my students sufficiently.\n\nWe can all agree there are many measures of classroom rigor. But what you may not agree with is my belief that rigor is associated with grade distribution. On several occasions, students have written in the Beacon about grade inflation and classroom rigor. But so far, I’ve read nothing from a faculty perspective regarding these critical areas in education.\n\nA few weeks ago, I overheard the following in the Little Building dining hall: “I have a friend at Harvard who told me that she slept during her class almost every Tuesday morning, and she still got a B in the class” (repeated here verbatim).\n\nMy next-door neighbor is the HR Director for a large financial institution in Boston. She told me the other day that she pretty much disregards graduating seniors’ grade points (unless they’re terrible) since it’s “common knowledge” in the corporate world that colleges are giving out undeserved As and Bs.\n\nGrade inflation is what I call a transactional problem. Both professors and students co-create a situation whereby high grades are being passed out to undeserving students. At times, some professors give sub-par students high grades and at other times, some students aim low and work toward achieving the minimum level expected of them in the class.\n\nTeaching and learning need to be so much more.\n\nHere’s what I know: First, I realize that the vast majority of professors and students are doing their best to ensure academic integrity on the Emerson campus. Yet, despite Emerson being a school with a rather selective admission process, scores of students have received a higher grade than they deserved. Heck, I’m sure I’m guilty of this practice myself. There are some courses on this campus where students receive As and Bs because they’ve acquired the necessary competencies (e.g., internships, directed studies, etc.). But what about other courses?\n\nColleagues: If you are not doing it now, you should consciously ensure that learning standards are met for each of your students. And, as I try to do on a regular basis, grading should be done with discernment. There is a difference between awarding an A to a student who is meeting the course objectives and a student who is excelling in them. When we grade more strictly, it’s likely that students will rise to the standards set. Finally, as my colleague ­— a dean at a private school in the Midwest ­— contends, no professor should distribute high grades because students are paying high tuition. We might as well toss in the teaching towel if we operate with this assumption.\nStudents: What exactly do you hope to get out of a class if you’re simply sitting in the course absorbing the atmosphere without contributing to it? The classroom is a shared experience between you and the professor. If you complain about the lack of rigor and the “easy A,” you should also figure out if you’ve done anything to make the class a more challenging experience. What standards of excellence do you bring into a course? Submit your best work with each assignment. And, when you receive a grade—other than an A—take it as a learning opportunity.\n\nClearly, I don’t believe that high grades in a class must mean it was a blow off for students. But, despite the various views on this topic, every compelling discussion of education addresses the interplay between grades and a class that stretches the mind and engages the academic soul.\n\nWhile teachers may become more honest graders and students become more attentive learners, all of us on this campus need to begin a candid dialogue about what is happening with grades around here and the various levels of interpretation surrounding them.\nAs I continue to focus on improving my teaching, I must also continue to think about my grades and student perceptions of the difficulty of my class. I refuse to be a teacher who teaches classes where students simply regurgitate back facts from a yellow-highlighted textbook. On the other hand, I don’t want to be a teacher where students look confused or disengaged because the material is beyond their grasp or the content has little resonance.-\n\nI want to be someone whom students view as accessible, interesting, and yes, challenging. I aspire to provide students the grades they deserve, hoping that those grades reflect a course and an instructor with appropriate classroom standards.","dt":"2011-02-03 01:17:10 -0800"},"179":{"terms":[{"id":7,"name":"Opinion"}],"title":"Improve yourself by improving your community","body":"<strong>Sara Prescott, <strong>Beacon Contributor</strong></strong>\n\nFlip through any student planner these days, and you will see class scheduled Monday through Thursday, scattered internship hours, student organization meetings, and sometimes a part-time job over the weekend. Emersonians are a busy bunch, but I can’t help thinking something is missing from the typical weekly schedule.\n\nTake a walk downtown and you will find several homeless shelters. Venture out of our three-block radius and you can find an understaffed community project. Emerson is located in an area of Boston in need of action by its local students. Just look around and it becomes obvious what that weekly planner needs.\nCommunity service is more beneficial than many of the internships students undertake. The responsibility placed on volunteers is much heavier than on interns. A community service volunteer is usually necessary to the success of the project. Their suggestions are taken into consideration by superiors; compare that to the menial work interns are delegated.\nRather than go through the motions at an internship, be the action. Dedicate your time and work to produce something meaningful, rather than pick up where the last intern left off. As an intern, you are often not missed once your replacement arrives.\n\nCommunity service is beneficial for your social and professional life, and no, not only in the sappy context. Community service equips you with certain traits, knowledge, and abilities, making you more marketable to employers. Volunteers are required to have self-initiative and resourcefulness as well as critical and creative skills for their service work. Participating in community service allows for introspection and encourages a person to be more understanding of others.\nSuzanne Hinton, the associate director of the Office for Service Learning and Community Action, reported that in 2010, 1,800 Emerson students clocked 51,000 total service hours. These hours were valued at approximately $1,457,000 for local communities, given that the 2010 value of a Massachusetts service hour was $28.52.\nOf those 1,800 participants, 51 students were enrolled in the Jumpstart program and were responsible for 14,515 hours themselves. According to my calculations, students not involved with Jumpstart dedicated 21 hours each over the course of the year. In the time it takes to watch season one of Buffy the Vampire Slayer again, you could volunteer and generate nearly $600 for the local community.\nMy experience with community service dates back to middle school. I started  working with the local Special Olympics team by shadowing the athletes during practices and games. This lead to my involvement with the Walk for Autism in Boston and Manchester, which connected me to helping clean up public parks, collecting can donations for food banks and later serving at shelters in Downtown Crossing.\nThe early exposure only encouraged me to participate more, and I know I have reaped the benefits from my involvement. I have a better understanding of the diversity and complexities of the world, and have directed my future career path in the nonprofit sector.\nCommunity service doesn’t need to be local, though. World Hunger reported in 2010 there were 925 million people living hungry. The World Health Organization states that approximately 100 to 140 million girls and women have been victim to female genital mutilation. Just because we do not bear witness to the issues affecting our global community does not mean they do not exist.\nRather than spending a couple of hours Facebook stalking the seemingly attractive and mysterious fellow in your Costume and Make-up Design class or wasting an entire afternoon going through @Lord_Voldermort7’s Twitter comments, get involved with an issue you take interest in. Do you want to lower the homeless population in Boston? Would you like to reduce Emerson’s “carbon footprint”? Maybe you could get the attractive, mysterious fellow to join you and fit something new into those gaps in your weekly planner.","dt":"2011-02-03 01:32:39 -0800"},"293":{"terms":[{"id":7,"name":"Opinion"}],"title":"Whose work is it anyway?","body":"<h1><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-size: 13px;\"><strong>Morgan Baker, Beacon Columnist</strong></span></h1>\n<div><strong>\n</strong></div>\n<div>When I started teaching, lo those many years ago, I knew there were some aspects of the job I wouldn’t be fond of: the pay, the occasional whiny student,  and sometimes, the papers I had to correct — especially when these papers piled into mountains by my desk, on my desk, on the chair and on the floor near my desk.</div>\n<div>\n\nThe pressure to return those papers in a timely fashion added to my stress. Not only did some students nag, I knew students couldn’t improve on their future work without seeing how they had done on their past work. Don’t get me wrong: students should expect papers back in a reasonable amount of time. You, and your parents, are paying good money for my services, and I should provide them. Read that again: I should provide them.\n\nWhat I discovered from last spring’s issue of the Chronicle of Higher Education is that some professors (hopefully not at Emerson) don’t have the time or inclination to correct their papers because their classes are too big or they’d rather spend their time on research or with students in the classroom.\n\nWho wouldn’t? That’s the fun stuff. So they’re outsourcing their papers — not to their TAs, because even they can’t handle the workload — but to where most outsourcing goes: to Asia.\nIf I can’t handle my workload, I can hire Virtual-TA, a subsidiary of EduMetry, Inc., in Virginia to help me. According to its website, the company trains many Masters and PhDs in multiple subjects to correct papers using rubrics — something else I detest. Writing should be original, not written to a rubric. Both websites made me want to puke as a parent and a professor.\n\nAs a parent, I assume when my daughter signs up for particular teachers, they’ll be correcting her papers — not someone who doesn’t know what she looks like.\n\nStudents select teachers based on reputations they garner from past classes. They want to hear what their professors have to say in front of their class and on their papers.\n\nAs a professor, I’m nauseated. I correct my students’ papers. Maybe my students don’t always like what I have to say, and maybe I don’t always like doing it, but it’s part of my job description, and I do it even when I’d rather be doing other work or watching TV with my family. Generally, I enjoy reading those papers when I have the time and the mountains aren’t too high.\n\nIt’s not clear that only those who teach large classes are using these resources, but if classes are so big, and instructors are that overwhelmed, maybe colleges and universities should rethink class size so teachers can deliver on what they promised their constituents.\n\nProfessors, however, aren’t the only ones who are stressed. Students are too. Part of my responsibility is to model what I consider appropriate behavior. If I started outsourcing my work because I either have too much or I just don’t want to do it, would I then be encouraging you, the students, to outsource your work as well? According to the author of “The Shadow Scholar,” an article from the Chronicle of Higher Ed in November of last year, this kind of outsourcing is also a rising trend.\n\nThe author of that article is the one providing the services.  Writing under a pseudonym, he says he’s written thousands of application essays, theses, finished online courses in numerous subjects, and no one would be able to detect his work in a classroom because it’s all original.\nWhy go to school if you don’t want to take risks, improve, and see what you can learn in a classroom? It’s a colossal waste of time, energy, and money if you don’t put in the effort. Why do it? The only answer I can imagine is that students feel so much pressure these days to excel at everything, that they can’t run the risk of getting less than a perfect grade, let alone fail a class. So some outsource.\n\nI thought the point of college, however, was to experiment, to see what you’re good at and what you’re not so good at, what you like and what you don’t like. I took a history class in college, and trust me, that’s not my subject. I got less than a stellar grade, and I’m not talking a B either. Even at Emerson, where students often don’t have the opportunity to take courses outside their major, you can still experiment within your major or even within a class.\n\nWhat’s going to happen to students who don’t take risks and choose to outsource their work? What will they do when they graduate? How are they going to explain to their new bosses that they really aren’t as smart as they appear on paper?  “Oh sorry Mr./Ms. Boss, I didn’t really earn that A. My ghostwriter got it for me.”\n\nRegardless of the ethical issues around outsourcing, I’m mainly just sad. I’m sad that higher education is turning into a weird business where overworked teachers would even consider outsourcing, not just to TAs but to people who don’t even work in their schools. And, I’m especially sad some students are so stressed, that they’re not in school for the journey, but just for that glorious A — any way possible.\n\n</div>\n&nbsp;","dt":"2011-01-27 23:41:56 -0800"},"296":{"terms":[{"id":3,"name":"Arts &amp; Entertainment"}],"title":"With three guild wins, The King's Speech heats up Oscar race","body":"<!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 12.0px; font: 15.0px Arial} p.p2 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 16.0px Times; min-height: 19.0px} p.p3 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 15.0px Arial} --><strong>Hayden Wright, Beacon Staff</strong>\n\nThe Director’s Guild of America stunned the blogosphere when it bestowed Tom Hooper of <em>The King’s Speech</em> with its Best Director prize on January 29. Heavily favored  by most awards pundits was David Fincher, director of <em>The Social Network</em>, whose Oscar campaign appears to be losing steam by the day. Hooper’s win was regarded by most commentators as a seismic shift in the race for Best Picture, with many calling <em>The King’s Speech</em> a clear frontrunner.\n\nGranted, part of the fun of awards season are the moments of unpredictability. It is hard to characterize a constantly changing voting body exclusively by the decisions it has made in the past. Academy decisions can seem arbitrary and downright confusing, though it seems we never tire of speculating about the Oscars. And though there are eight other nominees, <em>The Social Network</em> and <em>The King’s Speech</em> are the only two to have won major precursors. Thus, the media has quickly turned this into a two-horse race.\n\nAnd <em>The King’s Speech</em>’s momentum has grown substantially. Hooper’s film also won at the Producer’s Guild Awards and Screen Actors Guild Awards. This was an unexpected turn, as many presumed <em>The Social Network</em> would dominate after receiving numerous critics’ awards and topping many year-end top 10 lists. It seemed to cruise to a Golden Globe win for Best Picture, a prestigious honor that is also deceptively unimportant when it comes to the Oscar race.\n\nThe Golden Globe for Best Picture has a spotty predictive history with the Academy. Globe winners as recent as <em>Avatar</em>, <em>Atonement</em>, <em>Babel</em>, <em>Brokeback</em> <em>Mountain</em>, and <em>The Aviator</em> failed to repeat at the Academy Awards. Unlike SAG, DGA, and PGA, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which determines the Golden Globes, has no membership overlap with the Academy.\n\nGuilds are comprised of members of the industry, whose fingers are almost always closer to the pulse of Hollywood than critical bodies like the Golden Globes. No Golden Globe winner in the past 20 years has gone on to win Best Picture at the Oscars without being endorsed by at least one of these guilds — <em>The Social Network</em> would be an unprecedented winner.\n\nHowever, perhaps SAG, PGA, and DGA’s decisions betray a deeper conservatism that permeates the most august corners of Hollywood — an unabashed love of old-fashioned filmmaking and a hesitancy to embrace edgier fare.\n\n<em>The King’s Speech</em>, an old-school adversity story about King George VI’s efforts to overcome his stammer, is by all definitions a classic piece of Oscar bait. The pedigreed cast and feel-good material (not to mention its prime location at the beginning of World War II) makes it exactly the type of film the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences goes nuts for.\n\nStagey period drama is an Oscar mainstay (think <em>Shakespeare in Love</em> and <em>The English Patient</em>) and <em>The King’s Speech</em> even won over critics who may have become cynical about stuffy period work. By most accounts, it is a vibrant and thoroughly entertaining piece of cinema, by any standards.\n\nOn the other hand, <em>The Social Network</em>, the story of Facebook’s founding, is rife with slimy techies who guzzle appletinis and demonstrate less loyalty than Benedict Arnold. The characters engage in quick, backstabbing courtroom banter, squabbling over billions like the whiny, entitled children they are. Its brilliant portrayal is perhaps too honest for Oscar: <em>Rolling Stone</em>’s Peter Travers and other critics insist that it “sums up the spirit of a generation.”\n\nIf that spirit is characterized by a simple lack of values, Oscar might not be ready to embrace it. And frankly, the innovation of its characters is overwhelmed by their sheer detestibility. Granted, the AMPAS has fawned over corrupt and spineless cultures in the past, but often within the context of a mobster or western fantasy. <em>The Social Network</em> then could be a little too honest, recent, and specific to our times.\n\n<em>The Social Network</em> may be a searing statement piece, but the loveliness of <em>The King’s Speech</em> can’t be denied. It received 12 Oscar nominations this year, more than any other film in competition, and four more than <em>The Social Network</em>’s eight. This disparity is made greater by the nominations Fincher’s film did not receive, like Best Supporting Actor honors for Andrew Garfield (who was nominated for most precursors).\n\nIt could be a clear sign that the odds are in Hooper’s favor for the big prize. Though, as the cliche goes, it’s an honor just to be nominated.\n\nThe 83rd Academy Awards will take place on Feb. 27, 2011 at 8 p.m. and are televised on ABC.\n\n&nbsp;","dt":"2011-02-03 00:18:12 -0800"},"297":{"terms":[{"id":3,"name":"Arts &amp; Entertainment"}],"title":"Shepard Fairy originals for sale on eBay","body":"<!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 12.0px; font: 15.0px Arial} p.p2 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 16.0px Times; min-height: 19.0px} p.p3 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 15.0px Arial} --><strong>Alicia Lazzaro, Beacon Correspondent</strong>\n\nBy coughing up a mere $100, you have the chance to own an original Shepard Fairey — or at least a piece of it.\n\nAn eBay vendor has listed a small piece of Fairey’s mural obtained from the Deitch Wall in New York City at a starting bid of $100. The mural was a mishmash of Fairey’s designs composed in his signature red hue. Even though just a piece of it is being sold, it represents a larger picture of Fairey’s work.\n\nAlong with peers like the elusive Banksy and quirky Invader, Shepard Fairey has made his way into the street-art scene. Fairey began his artistic career by replicating his designs on skateboards and T-shirts. His career was transformed when he burst onto the street art scene, plastering his work all over major cities in the country. Fairey is known for designing Barack Obama’s famous campaign poster. His signature mark, however, is the Andre the Giant Obey design, which can be seen in many forms all over the country splattered on the walls of buildings and pinned to street signs.\n\nDespite being illegal, or perhaps because of it, street art has accrued a major presence in the art world, as seen by the success of the documentary <em>Exit Through the Gift Shop</em>. It has transformed what some audiences would just label “graffiti” into a stand-alone art form. From posters to paintings to stickers, street art has become a prominent form of self-expression, usually with a political or social meaning behind it.\n\nThis development could have a lasting impact on the way art is sold. “Every artist needs to make a living. Fairey is an interesting example of an artist becoming adept at using the media,” said Judith Hull, architectural historian and Emerson art history professor. Online shopping has the potential to put artists on the map, especially street artists. This may legitimize street art for some disbelievers.\n\nThis may also impact the art world at large. Ownership of fine art will not be limited to those with deep pockets and the private jet to travel to an Italian gallery. The average art lover may not have $50,000 to spend on an original in an art gallery, but would be willing to drop $100 on a print just a click away on eBay.\n\n“eBay will put something up for sale and make it widely accessible, but it won’t serve the function of a broker,” said Hull. Selling art online may be working for Fairey, but it may not work for everyone. “Artists still need those brokers. Not all artists will make a living [selling their work] on eBay,” she said.\n\nSerious art buyers may question the authenticity of eBay, despite efforts to legitimize the online community. “People who buy from big auctions are buying for authentication.

This anniversary is one that owner and sole staffer Angela Sawyer sees as cause for celebration, considering the shop’s narrow appeal and the music industry’s shakiness.\n\nBut even from the start, Weirdo’s fittingly nontraditional journey has been a testament to the idea that even the most bizarre stuff has relevance and appeal in Boston’s culture.\n\nSawyer, who performs in several local experimental music acts, first started Weirdo in 2006 as nothing more than a website and a mailing list. But the project generated so much interest among Boston sub-cultural fanatics that she began allocating hours for people to browse records in her apartment. As Weirdo’s fanbase continued to grow, Sawyer eventually decided she needed more room.\n\nDespite some skeptical friends and her own low expectations, Sawyer continued with her plan for an actual storefront, and subsequently found herself once again shocked by the reaction. The store has become a hub for the Boston area’s experimental music scene, thanks not only to the rarity of its content, but also its essentially ever-open doors: Weirdo is even open on most holidays, when customers are frequently treated to snacks and screenings of obscure films.\n\nAnyone who has been inside Weirdo’s current location may have trouble believing that it was much\n\nof a spatial upgrade — the shop’s website does not exaggerate when it describes the store as “smaller than the average dorm room.” But Sawyer says it has made a big difference.\n\n“I had about this much room before, but I had a couch and television set,” she told the <em>Beacon</em>. “And roommates.”\n\nNow two years in and still thriving, Sawyer is preparing to celebrate both Weirdo’s success and the enthusiasm of Boston’s deep underground scene — from the esoterically-inclined record collectors, to the appreciators of rare cinema, to the local noise-creators and performers themselves — with a birthday concert.\n\nThe lineup for the Feb. 5 bash, in order to acknowledge the theme of “two,” comprises several duos — some of which have taken part in Weirdo’s Series on Mondays, the shop’s weekly program that draws in-store performances by artists whose niche appeal make them unbookable at many area venues.\n\nThe anniversary event will take place at the Whitehaus, a junk-covered Jamaica Plain residence that several area musicians call home, and it really couldn’t be anywhere else. The dwelling’s frequent house concerts and its dismantling of the traditional performer-audience dynamic have made the Haus a sort of counter-cultural Xanadu among Boston music fans. Though yowling, stomping hootenannies are the specialty, any outsider art — including free-form poetry, performance art, experimental film, and combinations of those three — has a place at the Whitehaus.\n\nWith the concert, Sawyer hopes to strike down barriers within the scene itself. The lineup — handpicked by Sawyer — features acts of deviating styles that usually wouldn’t be seen on the same bill. Indeed, Neptune’s homemade scrap-instruments and dizzying tremors of noise are a far cry from Cotton Candy’s whimsical and shiny power-pop.\n\nThe bill’s stark contrasts highlight a key message of Weirdo: that even the most outlying music can have a unifying power.\n\n“For the general population — people who only pay as much attention to music as I do to shirts — there’s this idea that this music is difficult,” Sawyer acknowledged. “I understand not everyone is going to be interested in a recording of someone banging their own head with a kitchen pot.”\n\nTo break down the stigma, Sawyer actively promotes an “unsnooty” attitude in the store. Listening to “weird” music, she says, isn’t about trying to be challenging: it’s about being open.\n\n“I’m most interested in not having fences inside my head about what I listen to,” she described. She sees herself in an ongoing quest to explore what makes a recording, regardless of genre or era, have quality. “I feel like that’s a project that anyone who wants to can work on.”\n\nAnd Weirdo Records seems like the ideal headquarters for that mission — everyone is welcome, they just might not be able to fit.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWeirdo Records (844 Massachusetts Ave., Cambridge) is open 11 A.M. to 9 P.M. all week long.\n\nThe shop will host its second birthday party at the Whitehaus (10 Seaverns Ave., Jamaica Plain) on Feb. 5.","dt":"2011-02-03 00:20:38 -0800"},"333":{"terms":[{"id":5,"name":"Lifestyle"}],"title":"Spring Cleaning","body":"<div>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-size: 13px;\"><strong>Jamie  Bogert, Beacon Staff</strong></span></h1>\nThat ugly sweater you wore this Christmas is ready to be put back in storage or donated to Goodwill.

The three floors, each cover the franchise’s various brands, including Forever 21, Heritage 1981, Love 21 and 21 Men.\n\n“It was overwhelming in the best way,” said Mykah Murphy, a marketing communication freshman.\n\nForever 21 may be a new face among the storefronts of Newbury Street, but the budget-friendly fashion franchise has been around since the 80s. With over 355 locations across the country, it’s one of the 50 largest privately owned companies in Los Angeles.\n\nHowever, the clothing store was not always the well-known fashion line it is today. Forever 21, once Fashion 21, opened its doors for the first time on April 21, 1984 on Figueroa Street in downtown LA. Its owners, Don Chang and his wife, Jin Sook, had immigrated to the US from South Korea in pursuit of the American Dream.\n\nToday, Forever 21 is a big fish in the “fast fashion” pond. Fast fashion focuses more on following the newest trends, whether they’re coming from big or small designers, but doing so on a budget. As a result, while paychecks dwindle and other stores struggle to clear out their inventory, customers flock to Forever 21.\n\n“I like the variety of options they supply,” said Lindsay Day, writing, literature, and publishing junior. “I’m just afraid to go because I spend all my money.” According to Forever 21’s profile on Yahoo! Finance, their top competitors in the fast fashion niche are Charlotte Russe and H&amp;M.\n\nForever 21 is no doubt a popular brand among many Emersonians. “It’s really cheap and really fashionable at the same time,” said Meaghan Barry, marketing communication junior.\n\nSince a 2004 campaign by PETA2, the younger generation of animal activists, Forever 21 even has animal lover appeal since it stopped selling designs made with animal fur.\n\nBut at the end of last year, Forever 21 made headlines for less favorable news. Major designers like Diane Von Furstenberg and Gwen Stefani filed lawsuits against the company for copying their designs and patterns. Most of the brand’s appeal however, lies in their ability to offer styles closely resembling those fresh off the Fashion Week catwalk, and squabbles likes these don’t seem to discourage shoppers from getting the most out of their buck. “Being fashionable at a cheaper price sounds very appealing to me,” said Murphy. “I’m not brand loyal so that makes me more inclined to shop at Forever 21.”\n\n&nbsp;","dt":"2011-02-03 02:13:11 -0800"},"336":{"terms":[{"id":5,"name":"Lifestyle"}],"title":"Dressing like a young professional","body":"<h1><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-size: 13px;\"><strong>Elizabeth Venere, Beacon Correspondent</strong></span></h1>\nResumé, check.\nCoffee, check.\nOutfit, yikes.\n\nTime for your first job interview, and you don’t have anything to wear that wasn’t purchased at Urban Outfitters. And if you do, getting that coffee stain out will take forever.\n\nSure, as an Emersonian you’re most likely up-to-date on all the latest runway trends, but do those really translate into acceptable interview and internship ensembles? How do you dress like a young professional?\n\nSince most of us do not have Stacy London or Clinton Kelly, the hosts of What Not To Wear, on speed dial, the Beacon sound some guidelines.\n\n“The first thing anyone should do is research the company,” said Jason Guttilla, president of the Emerson College Fashion Society. “That’s going to determine the dress code.”\n\nGuttilla said the interview outfit should never be flashy. Shoot for conservative. His advice for Emerson guys interning in any of the college’s fields: slacks and a button down shirt with a tie. He also said to keep in mind that the color of the shoes, socks, and belt should match.\n\nAccording to Guttilla, girls should stick with skirts or pantsuits, and opt for flats or low heels. Stockings or tights are a must; bare legs are a no-no. In addition, Guttilla advised wearing only a simple necklace and bracelet, and keeping the make-up light and natural.\n\n“You want to impress them,” Guttilla said. It is important, though, to look like you belong. Ken Mattsson, an assistant director at Career Services, agreed. The outfit should reflect the job and the industry. “You want to be seen as one of them,” he said.\n\nMattsson also suggested dressing “one level more formal than the people” you’ll hopefully be working with. Ultimately, he said, you want their first impression of you to be that you look professional.\n\nOne way to ensure this is to remove anything distracting from your ensemble such as chunky or over-the-top accessories, and even perfume. “You don’t want anything that would distract the interviewer from what you have to offer,” Mattsson said.\n\nThis also applies to the amount of skin you show. Mattsson stated that many students often forget about this, and make the mistake of wearing things like fishnets and mini-skirts or low-cut tops to an internship fair or interview.\n\nHis suggestion is to find a way to show your creativity through your clothing that neither distracts nor shows too much skin. He said your ultimate goal is for the clothes to fade away and the interviewer to focus on your qualifications.\n\nThis doesn’t mean that professionalism has to be drab though. According to Guttilla, the best way to reflect your own style is through smaller pieces. He suggested personalizing with a tie or even bowtie for guys, and for ladies with the choice of shoe color and accessories.\n\nIf you’re completely lost, don’t lose hope. Some stores like Macy’s and Anthropologie have personal shoppers.\n\nJ.Crew offers complimentary personal shopping to customers with queries. Personal shopper AJ DiPirro at the store’s Boston location offered his expert advice for women: investing in a three-piece suit (jacket, skirt, and trouser).\n\nThis way, DiPirro said, you have versatility in your outfit choices to make many different ensembles. However, he did recommend wearing the jacket and trouser on the first interview, and saving the skirt for the more relaxed second interview.\n\nWhether you plan to work in a firm, the newsroom, or behind the camera, the most important thing to remember is to look the part. Be professional and look like you belong, but keep a hint of you in there.\n\n&nbsp;","dt":"2011-02-03 02:14:25 -0800"},"345":{"terms":[{"id":12,"name":"Auntie Em"},{"id":5,"name":"Lifestyle"}],"title":"Female Resident","body":"Dear Auntie Em,\n\nI have the most repulsive suitemates.

For a number of students, the unreliable and lengthy process of loading a web page on the college’s wireless Internet server is equally frustrating.\n\nFreshman Mike Tingley said he has issues almost every time he tries to get on the Internet, and it has been noticeably worse since returning from break.\n\n“Whenever I try to log on it will load a 16th of the page and then stay frozen like that forever,” said the broadcast journalism major. “I’ll just sit there clicking my [mouse] pad and refreshing the page to the point where I want to throw my computer out the window.”\n\nTingley said the shoddy service has begun to affect his ability to complete his schoolwork.\n\n“The Internet will go out right when I’m trying to submit a response on WebCT, which is due at a certain time,” he said. “My parent’s aren’t paying money for my Internet not to work.”\n\nRichard Grossman, director of information technology, said the college’s six-year-old WiFi network slows under the stress of increased users and interference from students’ independent wireless devices.\n\n“We are absolutely aware of the problem, and it is absolutely at the forefront of our minds,” Grossman said. “There has been a significantly increased demand for wireless Internet the past few weeks; we’re trying to make the necessary changes to solve that issue.”\n\nThe finicky Internet service is waring on students who said they frequently find themselves waiting 20 minutes for a page to load, or at times find themselves unable to get online at all.\n\nFreshman Mahesh Harwani said ECmobile lags at random and often inopportune times.\n\n“[The Internet] gives out right when you really need it without warning,” said the marketing communication major. “For a fine institution like Emerson College, it is less than satisfactory.”\n\nGrossman said the college plans to renovate parts of the network’s infrastructure, but declined to say the improvements would begin.\n\n“We’re working with a six-year-old wireless system, which we’re trying to update,” Grossman said. “We plan to upgrade the firmware and software in some devices we have, while some equipment will be replaced.”\n\nGrossman said his department recently began heat-mapping with the system, a process that pinpoints areas with the weakest WiFi. But he said it’s time to hire outside professionals.\n\n“We’re trying multiple different solutions to address the problem,” he said. “We’re replacing some of the older gear, and doing internal heat mapping ourselves, as well as having the vendor do an internal heat mapping as well, which will help a lot.”\n\nUntil the problems are solved, many students say they will resort to plugging in their Ethernet cables in order to gain satisfactory Internet access.\n\n“[The wireless] kicks me off all the time and is always so slow,” said freshman film production major Cassie Susemihl. “I use my Ethernet cable all the time.”\n\n&nbsp;","dt":"2011-02-03 03:46:46 -0800"},"355":{"terms":[{"id":6,"name":"News"}],"title":"Sophomore fears for family in Egypt as father reports on anti-gov’t protests","body":"<!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 15.0px Arial} p.p2 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 16.0px Times; min-height: 19.0px} --><strong>Anum Hussain, Beacon Staff</strong>\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_356\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"150\" caption=\"Photo Courtesy of Hannah Fleishman\"]<a href=\"http://www.berkeleybeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/100_1178.jpg\"><img class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-356\" title=\"100_1178\" src=\"http://www.berkeleybeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/100_1178-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>[/caption]\n\nAt 11:30 Wednesday morning, sophomore Hannah Fleishman received a call from Cairo, Egypt. It was her mother.\n\nClare Fleishman told her daughter that protesters in Egypt, who are demanding a democratic country, have split into two opposing parties after President Hosni Mubarak announced he will not seek re-election in September. One half has been satisfied, while the other wants Mubarak to resign immediately, Fleishman said.\n\nThe marketing communication major watched as the two parties tossed Molotov cocktails at each other on Al Jazeera live.\n\n“I told my mom I was scared,” said Fleishman, who moved to Egypt in 11th grade and speaks to her parents in Cairo every other day. “I’ll be in tears, and they’ll say it’s not that bad. My mom goes to the grocery store and dad goes into downtown. I want to be there; be there to witness it.”\n\nFleishman first heard of the prospects of a protest when her father, a foreign correspondent for the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>, called to tell her he was going to report on it. Three days later, Egypt made frontpage headlines in every major newspaper.\n\n“I consider it home,” said Fleishman, who most recently visited the Middle Eastern country over Christmas break and hopes to return in the Spring. “I feel nostalgic for it all the time. When I saw it happening on TV, I started crying. It’s hard to see a place you come from falling apart like that.”\n\nFleishman added that most of the protesters are in their mid-20s, not much older than her classmates at Emerson, many of whom are seniors hunting for jobs.\n\nSimilarly, those in Egypt are facing unemployment in a repressive environment, according to Joshua Rubenstein, northeast regional director of Amnesty International U.S.A.\n\n“People go to college, graduate with skills and training but can’t find jobs,” Rubenstein said in a phone interview with the <em>Beacon</em>, speaking from his office in Somerville, Mass. “In a society where they cannot express themselves, that frustration doesn’t have a legitimate outlet, which is part of what’s fueling these demonstrations.”\n\nAs the events in Egypt unfold, Rubenstein said there have been executions and imprisonment of journalists. Just yesterday CNN’s Anderson Cooper was pummeled by protesters’ fists.\n\n“Got roughed up by thugs in pro-mubarak crowd… punched and kicked repeatedly. Had to escape. Safe now,” Cooper tweeted Wednesday.\n\nMore than 1,200 American citizens in Egypt have been evacuated, according to a daily press briefing Monday on the U.S. Department of State’s website.\n\nBut Fleishman said her father Jeff is still stationed in Cairo. Although he was supposed to move to Kenya in March, the revolution in Egypt may keep him in Cairo for another year, Fleishman said.\n\n“He doesn’t even want to leave; that’s where the story is,” Fleishman said, adding that her parents have a 4 p.m. curfew for safety, imposed by Mr. Fleishman’s job. “When this started I got really scared, but he doesn’t seem too worried about getting attacked or hurt.”\n\nFleishman said she will be participating in a protest for Egypt in Boston this Saturday at an announced location. The protest is the second of its kind, following a demonstration last Saturday where hundreds marched from Harvard Square into downtown Boston.\n\n&nbsp;","dt":"2011-02-03 03:49:39 -0800"},"358":{"terms":[{"id":6,"name":"News"}],"title":"Number of applicants spikes, particularly minorities","body":"<!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 16.0px Times New Roman} p.p2 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 16.0px Times; min-height: 19.0px} --><strong>Katie Prisco-Buxbaum, Beacon Staff</strong>\n\nEmerson College experienced a 21 percent jump in minority applicants over the past year, after new initiatives to increase diversity on campus were put in place.\n\nMJ Knoll-Finn, vice president of student enrollment, said Emerson sent student volunteers to high schools in their hometowns to talk to guidance counselors and perspective students. The college invited some guidance counselors to visit Emerson to familiarize themselves with the school and its programs as part of the Strategic Diversity Plan.\n\n“Last year the college paid for guidance counselors from high schools serving predominantly urban, minority students to fly to Boston and get acquainted with the college’s professors and academic programs,” Knoll-Finn said.\n\nKnoll-Finn said the Strategic Diversity Plan, a set of goals mapping out strategies to increase minority applicants, was started at the request of alumni, the Board of Trustees and students. One goal of this plan is to keep the percentage of diverse students at a minimum of 20 percent, which Emerson has exceeded by about four percent.\n\n“We have an obligation as a higher education community to prepare our students to go into a world that is diverse,” said Gwendolyn Bates, associate vice president for diversity and inclusion. “It’s not enough to attract and retain people of color, it is also important for us to make everyone on campus feel like they are part of the community.”\n\nRamon Calderon, a Latino freshman, was influenced by his guidance counselor and a teacher who is an Emerson alum to apply. Calderon, not knowing much about the school at the time, based his decision to apply solely on those recommendations.\n\n“Everyone looks at Emerson as a gay school or a hipster school and I feel that a majority of the students here are Caucasian,” the writing, literature, and publishing major said. “I do like that [the college] is reaching out to diverse people because a lot of people haven’t heard of Emerson.”\n\nCalderon said he has debated his suitemates over the validity of affirmative action at Emerson.\n\nHe refuted one suitemate who said that Calderon was accepted because of his Hispanic background, citing that he was valedictorian and had a high involvement in extra-curricular organizations. Ultimately, the debate ended with one conclusion, Calderon said: although trying to increase diversity at Emerson is a good thing, accepting someone into a school based on race is not.\n\nCalderon said that advertising the school’s desire to raise diversity can make it seem as if the process is more about numbers than credentials.\n\n“I think that trying to recruit more people from diverse backgrounds is good, but doing it just for the sake of looking good is not the reason you should accept someone,” he said.\n\nJon Allen, an African American freshman, said he believes that the strides Emerson is making will have a positive effect on the Emerson community.\n\n“I think it is good that they are targeting diverse students,” said the marketing major. “Emerson only accepts the best of the best students anyways; diversity only will benefit the school and allow students to learn from people with different cultures.”\n\n&nbsp;","dt":"2011-02-03 03:53:33 -0800"},"169":{"terms":[{"id":3,"name":"Arts &amp; Entertainment"}],"title":"Emerson Idol: The search for the next EVVY superstar","body":"<strong>Alicia Lazzaro, Beacon Correspondent</strong>\n<em>Tim Strain, Beacon Staff, contributed reporting</em>\n\nAmerican Idol has come to Emerson with the competition for the new EVVY Award for Outstanding Vocal Performer.

Each hopeful performed in front of the four producers of the show.\n\nJunior theater studies major Claire Kaiser, one of the final ten, said singing her rendition of “Don’t Rain on My Parade” was a unique experience.\n\n“I usually do musical theater on stage,” she said in a phone interview with the Beacon. “I didn’t know what to expect with four strangers and a camera in front of me…they had me pretend I got stung by bees and then sing.”\n\nWyso said that the pressure is necessary.\n\n“It’s designed that way because people that stand out in a pressure situation in front of four people will also stand out in front of thousands,” he said.\n\nAfter a series of callbacks, the top ten were chosen by the producers. For the past two weeks, the public has had the chance to vote for their favorite on the EVVY website. The public vote, which includes people outside of Emerson, counts for 25% of the overall vote; the remainder is filled by three industry professionals. Each judge will rank the performers on a scale from one to 10, with each judge having a quarter of the vote.\n\nThe first is Eric Hutchinson, a singer-songwriter and Emerson alumnus who has released three albums and performed in the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade. Second is Renee Grant-Williams, a vocal coach known for working with singers Miley Cyrus and Christina Aguilera. Don Grossinger is the last judge. He has worked as a sound mastering engineer and brings 25 years of experience and millions of records sold to the judges’ table.\n\nAll ten candidates plastered their Facebooks and Twitters with pleas to get out the vote.\n\n“We had to shut down the polls for an hour [a week ago] because the system was at max capacity…so we had to expand the system and how many votes it could take,” said Pat Lambert, creative executive producer and senior communication studies major.\n\nOnce the top three are revealed, the finalists will work to perfect their acts and to perform live at the EVVYs. Before they ham it up on stage, however, a short video will be played to show the road that each performer took to get to the Cutler.\n\n“We now have footage of them from the casting to this competition to once they are cast then finding out the dancers and working through the production and working with their vocal coach,” said Lambert.\n\nThe top three will perform on May 14, and at the end of the show an announcement will be made for everyone to text in their vote. Anyone watching, in the audience or at home, can vote. The grand prize-winner will be solely based on the public vote.\n\n“The EVVY Awards is essentially Emerson’s homecoming; it is our year-end gala where students from all walks of life, all different majors, come together and celebrate the past year at Emerson College and all the work they have done,” said Wyso. “It’s all about supporting your friends and family supporting their children.”\n\nKaiser can relate. “Cousins I haven’t talked to in years are leaving me messages. My aunt, friends from high school, people from my hometown. The support has been awesome.”\n\nLambert, too, said he is excited about the program.\n\n“It has always been a gigantic show, but this has been the year that it is at a new peak,” said Lambert. “The show has got lots of things that are different this year; but you will just have to come to find out.”","dt":"2011-02-10 00:44:33 -0800"},"182":{"terms":[{"id":9,"name":"Sports"}],"title":"Long-standing tournament rich in hockey heritage","body":"<strong>Gabe Souza, Beacon Columnist</strong>\n\nIt was the third period, Boston University vs. Boston College, and things were starting to get chippy.\n\nHistorically, BC and BU, two of the top teams in the vaunted Hockey East conference, don’t get along, and this was no exception. But this time, it meant more. Beantown bragging rights were on the line.\n\nFor this was more than just a hockey game. This went beyond just another Hockey East matchup. This was the second game of the 59th annual Beanpot Tournament. How they played would not only decide the outcome of the game but would become part of them, part of their team’s legacy, and part of college hockey history.\n\nIt’s about the culture of Boston hockey. It’s the history and the heritage, the duty these players feel to uphold the numerous NHL stars who came before them. Names like Bill Guerin of BC, (who played for eight NHL teams including the Boston Bruins and Pittsburgh Penguins), Chris Drury (captain of the New York Rangers), and numerous others.\n\nIt’s about a tradition that has produced the last three national champions, and nine total national champions since the NCAA started keeping score in 1948.\n\nNortheastern has only garnered four Beanpot championships; Harvard has 10.\n\nBut when these four teams meet at the TD Garden, the rest of the hockey world seems irrelevant. Records fly out the window. Harvard’s 4-17 mark entering Monday couldn’t have been more irrelevant. It’s about the intensity of the games and the honor of playing in the tournament which drives these players and fans.\n\nBy the start of the game, the 17,000 in attendance had the chants, or shall I say insults, flying back and forth.\n\n“Safety School,” the BC fans yelled at their Terrier nemisees.\n\nBU responded with, “Sunday School.”\n\nMost of the others I can’t repeat in newsprint.\n\nAnd while what happened was expected in most circles — Northeastern breezed by Harvard without a challenge and BC edged BU  — what happens at the Beanpot is more than what takes place on the ice.\n\nDon’t believe me?

Just seconds before, the BU Terriers displayed a gritty special teams effort killing off a BC power play with the game tied at two.\n\nWarsofsky took a stretch pass that put him all by himself behind the Eagles’ defense. BC goalie John Muse was the only thing that stood between the defenseman and a Terrier victory.\n\nWarsofsky deked to his forehand, and put the puck on his backhand. As Muse slid across the goal mouth, Warsofsky guided the puck off his stick, attempting to catch the Eagle goaltender out of position.\n\nMuse stood tall.\n\nRevenge, for the Terriers, would have to wait for another day.\n\nIn what was yet another thriller in the 59th annual Beanpot Tournament between two of college hockey’s greatest rivals, BC defeated BU 3-2, in a game that needed overtime to be decided. The result marked the fifth straight Beanpot meeting between the two teams that was decided by a single goal.\n\n“That was a great game of college hockey,” said BC associate  head coach Mike Cavanaugh, speaking on behalf of head coach Jerry York, who has laryngitis. “You had lead changes, breakaways stopped by both goalies; what else could you ask for?”\n\nThe back-and-forth game saw BC take an early lead, only to relinquish it within mere seconds.\n\nThe scoring began when Eagles’ sophomore defenseman Philip Samuelsson fired a shot from the point. The puck ricocheted off a BU defenseman and found its way over the shoulder of goaltender Kieran Millan. Samuelsson was drafted by the Pittsburgh Penguins two years ago, but chose not at the time not to go pro and instead become an Eagle.\n\nThe Terriers did not wait long to respond. Before the goal could even be announced to the crowd, only 38 seconds after BC had taken the lead, Garrett Noonan slid a slick no-look behind-the-back pass to teammate Wade Megan who sniped the puck into the far corner past Eagles’ net minder Muse.\n\nBoth teams came out in the second period with the same intensity and pace that had both student sections raucous throughout first frame. Two minutes into the second, BU’s Corey Trivino found a loose puck in between the circles and wristed a shot through the legs of Muse, giving the Terriers their first lead of the night.\n\nBU would take that lead into the third, only to quickly see it squandered. Just under five minutes into the period, the Eagles’ Jimmy Hayes took the puck off the near boards and fired a wrist shot that yet again deflected off a Terrier’s defenseman and found its way past Millan.\n\nAs both teams battled through the third, Muse and Millan stopped 15 and seven shots respectively, keeping their teams in the game.\n\nHowever, for Millan, in the extra frame, for the third time on the day, a puck hit one of his own teammates and ended up in the back of his net.\n\nThat was via Tommy Cross, who, on the power play, took a wrist shot that hit off the stick of a Terrier defenseman and jetted over Millan to clinch the victory for Boston College.\n\n“We talked about getting the puck to the net on the power play,” said Cross. “The shot got past the first wave of defenders and found its way in.”","dt":"2011-02-10 01:41:18 -0800"},"184":{"terms":[{"id":9,"name":"Sports"}],"title":"Northeastern cruises, takes down Harvard 4-0","body":"<strong>Evan Sporer, Beacon Staff</strong>\n\nPaws, Northeastern University’s mascot, fell down on the ice of TD Garden during the first intermission of the Huskies’ matchup against Harvard. The mascot laid on the ice, sprawled out on all fours, seemingly helpless.\n\nHowever, Paws was no indication of how Northeastern would come out of the intermission.\n\nThe Huskies’ players skated out of the locker room and hung a four on the scoreboard against its opponents from Harvard.\n\nIn the first round of the 59th annual Beanpot Tournament, Northeastern blanked Harvard 4-0 to advance to next Monday’s finals, where they will play the Boston College Eagles.\n\n“We’re one step closer to another title,” said Northeastern forward Mike McLaughlin.  The junior netted two goals on the day for the Huskies, including the game-winner that came off his first tally in the opening period. Northeastern has not won the Beanpot since 1988.\n\nSkating shorthanded down the ice on a two-on-one, McLaughlin elected to shoot instead of passing to his fellow Husky, sniping a wrist shot under the arm of Harvard goalie Ryan Carroll, just as a Harvard power play expired. The strike provided Northeastern with its first goal of the game.\n\n“I’ve been telling myself to shoot more,” McLaughlin said.\n\nThe junior forward’s goal came in what was an up-and-down first period, with Harvard out-shooting the Huskies 17-10 and seemingly well in the game.\n\nThen, McLaughlin struck again in the opening minutes of the second, doubling the Huskies’ lead. He took a pass from teammate Rob Dongara and rifled a shot that deflected off Carroll, careening into the air and floating into the net off the goalie’s backside. Ted Donato, Harvard’s head coach, said the goal subdued the Crimson attack.\n\n“After the second goal, we really couldn’t mount much of an attack,” Donato said.\n\nNortheastern kept the Crimson off the board, playing strong in its own zone. Goaltender Chris Rawlings  made 41 saves for Northeastern, consistently denying Harvard anything it threw at the net.\n\n“A shutout is great, but I was more concerned with winning the game,” said Rawlings, who said he was able to breathe easier as the Huskies continued to pad their lead.\n\n“Goals make my job easier,” said the sophomore from Vancouver. For the Canadian native, the Beanpot used to be an unfamiliar tournament, but he now understands the true magnitude of the games.\n\n“Being far away in Vancouver, you don’t really know a lot about the Beanpot,” said Rawlings. “But once you get [to Boston], you find out its one of the biggest tournaments in all of college hockey.”\n\nNow, for Rawlings and his teammates, the focus is on BC, and their coach knows just how big a Beanpot championship would be for the school.\n\n“They would have to get [Northeastern police] and the Boston police on our campus if we won,” said head coach Greg Cronin.","dt":"2011-02-10 01:43:49 -0800"},"185":{"terms":[{"id":9,"name":"Sports"}],"title":"Back in Boston area, Swarttz finds his stride","body":"<strong>Christopher Eyer, Beacon Correspondent</strong>\n\nNadav Swarttz might just be the right guy for the Emerson men’s volleyball game.\n\nIf you attend a game, you will probably see the powerful right hitter fly in from the right side and spike the ball on the opposition at somepoint during the match.\n\nThe transfer from the University of Maryland is leading the Lions with 45 kills, but Swarttz was not always the force he is today.\n\n“The first time I picked up a volleyball was freshman year of high school when we had intramurals. My friends and I, we’d go and have some fun,” said Swarttz, who is studying marketing communication.\n\nSwarttz said he tried out for the freshman team at Newton South High School, and made the cut.\n\nAlso playing for Newton at the time was Jeff Ackerstein, now a junior post-production major at Emerson. Ackerstein, who has played opposite Swarttz for the majority of his volleyball career, remembers when Swarttz was still in the learning process.\n\n“He’s made a big improvement. When he first started he was a small kid, and he’d make hits but they weren’t game stoppers,” Ackerstein said.\n\nSwarttz is listed at 5-feet-10 inches on Emerson’s roster. Junior captain Steve Selnick said Swarttz’s size has helped him get a leg up on the competition.\n\n“During his junior year, he started doing a program to increase his vertical leap,” Selnick said. “Once he did that, it all started to click. He started flying in from the right side and teams didn’t know what to do. He was the go-to guy on the right side.”\n\nWith Swarttz playing right side hitter and Ackerstein on the outside, Newton South, whose mascot is also a lion, went to the state semifinals.\n\nAckerstein said Swarttz continued to improve during the 2008-09 season.\n\nLater that year, Sports Illustrated picked Newton South as the top high school athletics program in Massachusetts, according to the magazine’s website.\n\nAs a freshman, Swarttz attended the University of Maryland. He played volleyball for Maryland at the club level, but said he found his heart wasn’t in it.\n\n“I played club for them and it was not the same,” Swarttz said. “It just wasn’t for me.”\n\nAt Maryland, Swarttz was often sick. He said he suffers from allergies, and the state’s environment did not agree with him.\n\nRealizing he needed a change, Swarttz transferred to Emerson, about a 20 minute drive from Newton.\n\nAckerstein said he was glad to be back with his teammate from Newton South.\n\n“It was after a year of not being on the court, so I could tell he was a bit rusty at first, but he’s really been a big help to the team and it’s been great playing with him again,” Ackerstein said.\n\nSwarttz said his transition into the college game has been helped by junior captain Steve Selnick.\n\n“[He’s] a great setter,” Swarttz said. “When [our passing] is on, we’re a lot better. Hitting is easy if you have good passing and good sets.”\n\nThe chemistry with Selnick has resulted in Swarttz racking 36 kills on the season\n\n“He’s definitely one of the go-to guys for Steve,” said Craig Letourneau, the Lions’ head coach. “Steve loves to send the ball to the right side because [Swarttz] can pound the ball. When he’s blocking, he leaps well and takes away a lot of the court with his hands.”\n\nThere are areas where Letourneau said he would like to see improvement in Swarttz’s game. He cited Swarttz’s tendency to hit the ball as hard as he can, even though sometimes he should back off and finesse it a bit more.\n\nThis season, Swarttz said one of his goals is to improve his conditioning and stay healthy.\n\n“I never knew volleyball players could run that much,” he said. “I feel like an old man sometimes, limping around and stuff. Volleyball takes a toll on your legs.”\n\nAll in all, however, the coach said he is happy with Swarttz’s output.\n\n“Nadav has been great. He has a great personality,” Letourneau said. “He’s very outgoing and very funny.

Wednesdays are also good. But whatever you do, never buy on Friday, Saturday, or Sunday. That would just be stupid.\n\nAccording to FareCompare.com, airlines usually file their airfare sales on Monday nights. Competitors scramble Tuesday mornings to match the lowered prices, and the sale prices are jerked offline by Thursday night. “A ticket can be $199 certain days and $499 other days even months ahead of time,” the Wall Street Journal reported earlier this year. When all is said and done, the average airline ticket is cheapest at 3 P.M. EST on Tuesdays.\n\nAirline tickets, rental cars, and hotel rooms are standard examples of goods subject to dynamic pricing that changes over time. Even if we’re not privy to the hour-by-hour fluctuations of airfares, most college students know they change faster than stock prices, and the process of snatching a cheap flight often feels like an online game of Whac-A-Mole.\n\nBut what most college students don’t know is that dynamic pricing exists elsewhere on the Internet. DVDs, shoes, clothing, textbooks — many of the goods we buy online — are wrapped in a dynamic pricing algorithm designed to squeeze those last few dollars out of your debit card.\n\nOnline retailers use your browser cookies or history of past purchases to calculate what you may be willing to pay for their products. The more you buy, the more information they amass, and they will often sell these digital dossiers to other vendors. Modern E-Commerce sites are like a digitized bazaar where the merchant sizes you up before offering the highest price he thinks he can get from you. But the customers don’t know they’re bartering, and the merchant is concurrently bartering with thousands of unknowing people.\n\nFor instance, members of 2007 Consumer Reports investigation found that a pair of boots left in an online shopping cart at Zappos.com increased in price by $3.95 when they returned to buy them four days later. In the same investigation, Barnes and Noble sold “a hard cover book for $20.80 on a Wednesday [that] suddenly rose to $26.00 on Friday.”\n\nAmazon pioneered the practice back in 2001. It used “a plethora of information gathered from customers, ranging from where they live to what they buy to how much they have spent on past purchases,” wrote the authors of Online Dynamic Pricing, a study on E-Commerce from the Virginia Journal of Law and Technology Association.\n\nAlmost every online purchase requires you to enter a mailing address, which retailers use to estimate your socioeconomic status. My second purchase might be more expensive if I ship my first purchase to Beacon Hill than if I sent it to, say, Dorchester. Last November, a consumer protection blog even caught Capitol One offering Chrome users better online car loan rates than it did to Firefox users.\nSixty-four percent of American adults did not know it is legal for a retailer to charge two different people different prices at the same time, according to the Annenberg Public Policy Center. But it is quite legal. And quite common.\n\nSome economists argue that dynamic pricing is nothing more than the latest innovation for companies trying to maximize their revenue streams. Business owners want to sell their goods at the maximum price consumers are willing to pay for them, and they have always known that this willingness varies between individuals.\n\nThese algorithms try to capture those small losses between a standardized price and the price an individual is willing to pay. The practice may be specious insofar as it leads consumers to believe they are being offered the same price as everyone else, but in the world of economics, it increases market efficiency.\n\nConsumers, however, are not without recourse. As Annie Lowrey writes in Slate, “consumers actually do hold the upper hand online.” There are innumerable price-comparison sites online, as well as “shopping bots” that will email you whenever prices on a specific item drop. Try out a browser plug-in called “The Invisible Hand,” which notifies you when lower prices are available on other sites for the product you’re currently viewing. Make use of these. And if you really want to ensure you’re getting the best price, run the same searches on multiple browsers, and remember to delete your cookies.

Everyday we make bad decisions and while we should be educated about the consequences of our actions, ultimately we should be free to do what we like—including smoke.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration has proposed new cigarette labels that will take up 50 percent of the upper portion of both the front and back panels of cigarette packages. The new labels will feature images alongside the stop smoking slogans we have become accustomed. According to the New York Times, all cigarette packaging will have a graphic warning label by Oct. 22, 2012.\n\nBut the 36 images the FDA unveiled do not help consumers make an informed decision. Instead, they use cheap shock tactics to guilt and embarrass people out of smoking.\n\nTake, for example, the photo proposed to accompany the phrase, “Warning: Cigarettes cause cancer.” The bared teeth at the top of the box are yellow and decaying. A few spots of gum stand out where incisors should be and, most nauseating of all, an open sore sits on the lower lip.\n\nRequiring companies to disclose the potentially dangerous effects of their products is standard. Alcohol and cigarettes have Surgeon General’s warnings and packaged foods have nutrition labels. But requiring companies to actively advertise against their product, on their product, is the government overstepping its bounds. I don’t question the effectiveness of labels like these­ ­— I question the morality.\n\nAs long as smoking is legal, people should be allowed to pick up a carton of cigarettes without being accosted by shocking images. It is the consumer’s choice to purchase what they want and not the government’s responsibility to do any more than ensure that they are aware of the risks. Pressuring us into making sound decisions is our parents’ jobs — not the FDA’s.\n\nWe all know smoking is bad. And we have known that it’s harmful for quite some time now. So why start with the graphic labels now?\nNo longer the vice of sophisticates and starlets, cigarettes project upon their users the image of an addict, forced to get their fix knee-deep in snow under the awning of 80 Boylston. We make many dangerous choices with little government warning. The difference is that it’s socially permissable to make some bad decisions; smoking just isn’t one of them.\n\nProponents of the labels may argue that it’s the government’s responsibility to discourage people from smoking so that their bad decision doesn’t raise our health care premiums. But contrary to popular belief, even the heaviest smokers are unlikely to raise your health care costs. As a matter of fact, according to USA Today, Vanderbilt University economist Kip Viscusi found that each pack of cigarettes smoked saves the country an average of 32 cents.\n\nSmokers die earlier and, because of this, end up costing the nation less in programs such as Medicare and Social Security during the course of their smoke-filled lives.\n\nMost smokers are not cigarette-bearing villains, threatening to puff pollutants in the face of unsuspecting children, and they are not stealing Medicare money from the innocent and deserving elderly.\n\nYes, smoking is terribly unhealthy for smokers and those immediately around them. But this does not sanction treating all smokers like our country’s nicotine-filled nemeses. Instead, the government should approach encouraging the public not to smoke, especially in the presence of non-smokers, the same way they promote vegetables and flu shots: With education.\n\nLay off on the spiteful on-package warnings. Instead, invest enough time and money in reminding people of the dangers of smoking so that they don’t want to pick up those cartons to begin with.","dt":"2011-02-10 01:56:43 -0800"},"190":{"terms":[{"id":3,"name":"Arts &amp; Entertainment"}],"title":"Gabriel Kuri opens consumerist exhibit at ICA","body":"<strong>Andrew Doerfler, Beacon Staff\n</strong><em>Sidney Dritz, Beacon Correspondent, contributed reporting</em>\n\nThe pieces in Nobody needs to know the price of your Saab, the first U.S. solo exhibit from Mexican-born artist Gabriel Kuri, do not actually contain any reference to Saab automobiles. But the collection, which debuted at the Institute of Contemporary Art on Feb. 2, does offer a fresh take on society’s fixation with price and material value.\n\nAfter viewing Kuri’s show, its title — an actual slogan from a Saab ad campaign — comes across less as a rejectionist statement and more as a concept to consider.  Kuri wants us to question the role of material value in our lives but not necessarily dismiss it outright.\n\n“I think of myself as making affirmations, not criticisms,” Kuri said at a session before his exhibit’s opening. He explained that his statements on consumerism are “not necessarily celebratory,” but are also not judgmental.\n\nTake Kuri’s triumvirate of 10-foot-tall tapestries — hand-woven by Mexican artisans — depicting three copies of a credit card receipt (for the customer, the vendor, and the intermediary). The piece’s name, “Trinity (Voucher in Triplicate),” might initially evoke the familiar denunciation of consumerism as a fanatical religion.\n\nBut Kuri explained that the work’s relationship to the Holy Trinity lies solely in the subject’s function — it examines the idea that each piece would be powerless without the other two. Despite such commentary, the literal icons shown in the artwork are significant to Kuri.\n\n“Something always grounds [my pieces] back to a more familiar experience,” he said.\n\nAnd familiar objects — such as receipts, parking tickets, miniature shampoo bottles from hotels, shopping bags, and financial newspapers – are plentiful in the collection. To Kuri, these items reflect the idea that acts of consumption make up some of life’s most significant moments. Through the exhibit, such residue of transaction gains its own relevance by depicting a “trail of life.”\n\nThe sculpture “Column 2009-2010” most literally follows this trail — and in a personal way. The piece represents the sum of Kuri’s purchases for an entire year: two vertical metal rods grounded in a concrete base lance through a series of his receipts and deli-style “take a number” stubs. These simple slips of paper — which most people immediately discard  —  end up conveying Kuri’s rising journey through life.\n\nKuri’s concern for familiar objects, though, doesn’t mean that his show discourages unfamiliar realizations. His work concerning statistics, in particular, highlights the complexity of situations that charts and graphs often fail to acknowledge.\n\nThe sculpture “Untitled (Double yellow wrapped outside-in bin),” for one, portrays a mutilated three-dimensional pie chart, each section separated from the others and filled with the packaging material in which the sculpture was transported to the museum. The image reminds viewers that every chart’s information has a backstory by connecting the story to the graph itself. “Overlapping statistics (blind olives eyelid)” similarly challenges the rigid interpretation of information: Various materials — plywood, glass, roofing — are cut precisely into rectangles but arranged sloppily atop each other, suggesting that seemingly straightforward information is often more complicated than a bar graph can portray.\n\nKuri doesn’t appear to believe, however, that we’re always fed information insufficiently.\n\nIn “Recurrence of the sublime,” three avocados in a bowl are wrapped in newspaper, a common ripening technique — the fruit appears to be thriving off the information.  Likewise, “Untitled (Diario económico/Economic Diary)” depicts three stacks of moss slabs intercut with financial journals, demonstrating the importance of awareness of the economic world despite its paradoxical and frustrating elements.\n\nKuri’s collection serves as a reminder that even though society might be too concerned with material value, one’s own path of transaction does tell a story worth examining. In other words, nobody needs to know the price of your Saab — except for you.","dt":"2011-02-10 01:59:44 -0800"},"191":{"terms":[{"id":3,"name":"Arts &amp; Entertainment"}],"title":"A look at Baumbach’s Greenberg, 2010’s most underrated film","body":"<strong>Sean Van Deuren, Beacon Columnist</strong>\n\nThe recent announcement of nominees for the 83rd Academy Awards gave me pause to reflect on one of my favorite films from the past year, Greenberg.\n\nAlthough Noah Baumbach’s quiet and painfully funny film was neither nominated for an Oscar nor received exceptional reviews, I cannot think of another film from last year (save for Aronofsky’s haunting Black Swan) that left as lingering an effect on me for so long after the initial viewing.\n\nNoah Baumbach, whose previous work includes the masterful The Squid and the Whale and Margot at the Wedding, creates lonely characters so deeply flawed they can at times feel unbearable. The titular character in Greenberg, as played by Ben Stiller, is no exception to Baumbach’s filmic universe of narcissists and self-deluded adults who act like children. In fact, Roger Greenberg, a 41-year-old recovering from a nervous breakdown, could be classified as the definitive Baumbach hero.\n\nGreenberg makes everyone around him uncomfortable and does so without any self-awareness. Friends have learned to interact from a distance, to guard against his self-centeredness. It’s hard to communicate with someone who only thinks about himself.\n\nWhen Greenberg’s love interest, Florence, portrayed so naturally by Greta Gerwig, goes on a rambling, playful monologue that seems to have no conclusion or point — except to invite intimacy — Greenberg, unable to trust her sincerity, shouts, “That was the stupidest story I’ve ever heard. What was the point of that story?”\n\nThe overreaction is cringe-worthy, as is almost every scene in Greenberg. His defense mechanisms, so exhaustingly visible, lead Florence to proclaim, “You like me so much more than you think you do.”\n\nAnd yet, as with many of Baumbach’s characters, it’s easy to care deeply for Greenberg while witnessing the tragic extent to which his erratic — and at times emotionally brutal — behavior is really a byproduct of his underlying insecurities. It’s his characters’ internal struggle with themselves that interests Baumbach, and to watch his films is to immerse oneself in that struggle. They demand participation in feeling empathy precisely for those incapable of it themselves.\n\nStill, the most common complaint by critics — and anyone I’ve shared my admiration of the film with — was that the consistent ugliness of the character ruined the movie. Or as David Edelstein put it in his review for New York Magazine, “Greenberg would be a heckuva movie if we could just get Greenberg out of there.”\n\nTo say I agree with that take on Greenberg would miss the mark almost as much as the criticism itself misunderstands its topic. I disagree not only with the sentiment in particular but with the logic in general. One cannot criticize a film because one “likes” or “dislikes” its characters. That is not a valid form of critique. It’s shallow thinking and limits the exploration of engaging material.\n\nYes, it’s more challenging to allow oneself to feel for unlikable characters, but that leads to a more rewarding experience. The phrase “hurt people hurt people” pops up often in the film, reminding the viewer that there’s more to understand about Greenberg’s wounded temperament.\n\nBy dismissing a film because of its character, one blocks deeper emotions of compassion and limits one’s own growth. That form of critique is like a therapist who decides not to treat a patient because they don’t get along with them, who would gain from that?\n\nOne can criticize a film because of underdeveloped characters, but that is certainly not the case in Greenberg. The film is a tough, though ultimately empathetic, character study and is almost novelistic in how it captures characters’ entire histories. Roger Greenberg is not easy to like, but so what? Perhaps there are too many films out there with likeable protagonists (ahem — The King’s Speech). In the end, he is at least relatable, which is what makes him so unsettling in the first place.\n\nBaumbach doesn’t hate his characters — he’s no Lars von Trier of dramadies — but he does attempt an honest look at people in crisis. The humor in his films is mixed with awkward hurt, and as a result becomes much more poignant, uncomfortable, and most importantly, human.\n\nThe final scene depicts Greenberg preparing to hang a picture for Florence, who is lying in bed and about to listen to a voicemail he drunkenly left her in which he declares, in his own hesitant way, that he loves her. It’s striking because for the first time in the film, Greenberg does something kind without expecting anything in return. It’s a quiet moment, and for that very reason an almost startling one to end on. But for a film that could have easily turned into a generic romantic comedy where the quirky eccentric is saved by a younger woman (as the film’s misleading trailer would suggest), Baumbach instead trusts the intelligence of his audience and ends on a more realistic note.\n\nGreenberg accepts the inner struggle of its protagonist while also gently hinting at the possibility of hope for him. Baumbach doesn’t offer conventionally likable characters; instead he explores complex emotions with a level of honesty which is refreshing in mainstream cinema and impossible to shake.\n\nSean Van Deuren is a senior writing, literature and publishing major.","dt":"2011-02-10 02:01:19 -0800"},"192":{"terms":[{"id":3,"name":"Arts &amp; Entertainment"}],"title":"Channing Tatum talks The Eagle and always playing a soldier","body":"<strong>Ryan Mazie, Beacon Correspondent</strong>\n\nBetween playing opposite Al Pacino in a cop drama and standing in as Vince Vaughn’s comic relief in two of his five films this year, model-turned-actor Channing Tatum is defying Hollywood expectations. Known as being the typecast pretty boy in romance flicks, he is diversifying himself into a movie star.\n\nWhile in Boston to promote his new film The Eagle (in theaters this Friday), Tatum talked to the Beacon and other press outlets at the Liberty Hotel. Tatum did not know what to make of his dramatic role jumping either: “I wish I could say there is a rhyme or reason or method to it, but really it is just the filmmaker, the story, and the character that comes by.”\n\nSet in 120 A.D., The Eagle stars Tatum as Marcus Aquila, a Roman soldier who daringly sets out beyond the empire’s walls to retrieve the golden eagle emblem of the ambushed Ninth Legion his father led to restore his family’s honor. Channing swims, ride horses, and sword-fights in an uneasy, violent journey in Oscar-winner Kevin Macdonald’s battle epic.\n\nThis is not Tatum’s first time playing a soldier. Whether he is fighting for love in Dear John or world safety in G.I. Joe, Channing tries to adapt his soldier mentality for each part differently but with every military role he takes, the common denominator is honor. “What a soldier does I think is the noblest thing that you can do no matter what your politics are. I just felt really scared to say I’ve done those things [soldiers do].”\n\nTatum sat down with the Beacon’s Ryan Mazie to discuss the film.\n\nBeacon:  This is definitely a very physical role, so how did you prepare?\n\nChanning Tatum: It was really kind of funny. [Director Kevin Macdonald] was like, “I don’t want it to look like you’ve been at the gym,” and I’m like, “That’s awesome (laughs). Done, that’s going to be perfect for me!” Then I show up and Kevin’s like (sighs), “I was thinking…tighter.” … And so it was chicken and broccoli and running, because these guys didn’t have a lot of fat in their diet. They were just wiry, tough men. They were always on the move. But the running and the swordplay were grueling enough. We spent six to seven hours a day at it. The story is being told within the choreography. You just can’t do a bunch of sword action and still remain within the story. So that’s the interesting part — seeing how it’s going to be played out. … But it was still a lot of fun. They yell, “Cut,” and you’re just like [giggles like a girl], “That was crazy!”\n\nBeacon: You said in an interview that having this role was one of your childhood dreams. Did it live up?\n\nCT: Yeah, in so many different ways and in ways I never imagined. You get a second glimpse for what it really was like. Even though it’s a movie, when you are in a battle, a scrum like that, you can’t even imagine … [Kevin Macdonald] really wanted to do long takes so we could show a whole run. Like the [beginning scene fort fight], that was one of the craziest experiences ever… it was just a melee... I could not breathe afterwards. It was so exhausting. But these guys fought weeks at a time; sometimes months. I wish I could say that I was that tough. I would have never been able to do it. They were just different men back then.\n\nBeacon: It sounds like you did all of your own stunts.\n\nCT: Yes, I did everything but a few different riding scenes that they wouldn’t let you do or they didn’t have time because you were shooting something else.\n\nBeacon: When you were working with Jamie Bell, how did you go about creating the relationship?\n\nCT: We just hung out and ran around Budapest and Scotland. We just spent every waking moment with each other… It was a hard ride shooting, but there is nothing you can do throughout that type of a thing but just forge a friendship. You are miserable every day, and if you can just look to your right and see a face that you know is going through the same exact thing as you are, you just kind of have to laugh all the way through it. We’d be making up songs and music and be singing them while we are getting ready to jump into a freezing river and you are like, “What are we doing? This is so crazy.”\n\nBeacon: One thing that impressed me about The Eagle was that all the battles had real extras. So how do you compare working with real actors and working with computer graphics like in G.I. Joe?\n\nCT: I mean, the stuff in G.I. Joe, it’s hard to understand.  You’re in a half-built pod and [the director] is like, “Lean left”, “Lean right”, “Missile blowing up!”, “Shoot now!” and they just give you directions like that.  It’s hard to compare the two.  I like hand-to-hand combat. I love martial arts in general.  I’ve done it my entire life.  It’s just so much more tactile and you can feel like you’re really in it. But there are other opportunities, I think, coming down the road that CGI will be just as fun, because you can really stretch the world of reality.\n\nBeacon: I was surprised to see you are already a producer. Was it hard to do both at once?\n\nCT: Yeah, with Ten Year. It’s about a ten-year reunion. We have like 18 30-year-old actors so it’s like, a crazy experience, and it’s very, kind of like Diner, free form and loose. You got to figure out what kind of producer you will be.  Will you be the line producer or more of a creative producer?  It’s a delicate line to walk [that] you must handle in the right way — though I really did enjoy it.  It is a tricky thing to do for the first time because it’s really taboo to give notes.  You should never ever give notes to an actor that doesn’t want it or doesn’t welcome it. I found myself trying to navigate that, being a producer, and having to be behind the camera as well. I just decided the way I’ll go at it is just simply talk about the story arc and the scene.\n\nBeacon: Branching off into so many different areas, what advice do you have for young filmmakers?\n\nCT: Man, just do it ... If you think you might want to go do something, don’t wait, start failing early. I want to direct one day.  I want to start failing early at it so hopefully by the time I’m older, I’ll have more experience in life and the industry.  Whatever it is, just do it... Set yourself up to fail.  Literally, so you know what you’re not supposed to be… [Producing Ten Year, I’ve already made] a lot of different decisions and some are the right ones and some are the really wrong ones.  So again, failing early!","dt":"2011-02-10 02:02:53 -0800"},"193":{"terms":[{"id":3,"name":"Arts &amp; Entertainment"}],"title":"Terminus opens at the Paramount","body":"<strong>Taylor Paul, Beacon Correspondent</strong>\n\nBostonians needn’t wait for St. Patrick’s Day to celebrate Irish culture — at least as far as Boston theater is concerned.  ArtsEmerson is giving the stage to Mark O’Rowe’s Terminus as part of its ongoing Irish Festival of plays, films, and readings.\n\nTerminus, written and directed by O’Rowe, is a dark fantasy with a sprawling setting, from Dublin to the depths of Hell. The tale unfolds through three characters —  a mother and daughter with a turbulent relationship (Olwen Fouéré and Catherine Walker) and a soulless psychotic (played by Declan Conlon). Their lives progressively abandon reality as the night goes on, crossing paths with angels and demons in a dense, otherworldlynarrative.\n\nThe play is composed entirely of monologues, a method that is old hat for O’Rowe since writing his breakthrough work Howie the Rookie over a decade ago. In Terminus, he furthers his signature style by transforming the monologues into rhyming verse. In giving his words a bit of a lyrical lift, O’Rowe abandons traditional dialogue in favor of theatrical poetry.\n\nTerminus is the latest in O’Rowe’s 16-year career as both a playwright and screenwriter. While 1999’s Howie marked his first and biggest success, he emerged on the theater scene a few years earlier as part of a movement of Irish playwrights that included the likes of Conor McPherson and Martin McDonagh (whose play The Cripple of Inishmaan played at ArtsEmerson Feb. 2-6). His peers have arguably had more success at achieving an American presence over the last decade. However, the seven-city U.S. tour of Terminus, with ArtsEmerson as the first stop, has the potential to change his lacking international notoriety.\n\nTerminus is presented by the Abbey Theatre, a historical fixture of Ireland’s theater scene. The company has roots in Boston, having made its U.S. debut in the city exactly a century ago this year. Culture Ireland, the arts agency of the Irish government dedicated to promoting its local arts abroad, also had a hand in bringing the show to Boston.\n\nThe Terminus tour is just one component of its “Imagine Ireland” season of events, which includes several other readings and performances that recently hit ArtsEmerson’s Irish Festival. With its “world on stage” mantra and commitment to bringing international theater here to Boston, ArtsEmerson is a logical fit to partner up with these theatrical entities and bring an offbeat work like Terminus to the Paramount stage.","dt":"2011-02-10 02:03:39 -0800"},"194":{"terms":[{"id":3,"name":"Arts &amp; Entertainment"}],"title":"X Dance at Emerson","body":"<strong>Micaeli Rourke, Beacon Correspondent</strong>\n\nThis weekend, Emerson Stage’s annual production of X-Dance will grace the stage of the Greene Theater.

And they ought to.\n\nOne: Logistics.\n\nA “reverse housing” lottery potentially forces rising juniors to choose between living in the dorms and living with their friends. Instead of having the option to apply for residency requirement exemptions in groups of four or five potential roommates, sophomores must apply individually, and hope their future roommates will also be “deselected.” They risk going out into Boston roomie-less, while their friends are assigned to live in a double with a freshman in the LB.\n\nWe suspect many sophomores won’t want to make this gamble and will avoid the “reverse housing” process altogether. This could lead to the opposite problem: too many residents and not enough beds. So then what? Kick the excess juniors out at the last minute?\n\nWhile required to live on campus the first six semesters, students are only guaranteed housing for the first four. That sounds pretty ugly.\n\nTwo: Social Implications.\n\nWhile administrators may be okay with the prospect of Emerson lions living in close proximity to freshman and sophomore cubs, they may be over-looking the social implications of the arrangement. The distance between a freshman’s and a junior’s college outlook is often wider than three years. Dorms should be a safe haven for newbies, where students can share the challenges of college with the support of friends. Too many Emerson-experts walking around the residence halls will only make college more intimidating for the already freaked-out freshmen.\n\nThree: Booze.\n\nMost juniors can legally drink. And they do. Increasing the number of juniors living on campus opens a whole new can of beer. Maybe administrators believe of-age students will comply with the strict limits on alcohol, but it’s more likely that a host of new issues — 21 year-old students buying booze for underage students, for example — will be shouldered by the school’s residence life staff. Resident assistants already have enough (drunkenness) to worry about.\n\nWe acknowledge that yearly housing placements are challenging. Each year, administrators have to guess whether the college will have a greater or smaller number of new students than it has on-campus beds.\n\nBut Emerson is pretty bad at guessing, and it’s hardly fair to deflect the consequences of the college’s miscalculations on juniors who want to live out in the city. Juniors and seniors: Remember when the college had to house students in neighboring hotels? In 2007 and 2008, students had a lottery to get on campus. Now we aren’t allowed off?\n\nThe changes Emerson has undergone in past years have been numerous and substantial. But this residency requirement should be a temporary fix, not a permanent situation. Emerson should not allow short-term financial problems to erode our college’s particular culture. We are “on the pulse of an international city,” not a three-block section of it.\n\n&nbsp;","dt":"2011-02-03 23:06:12 -0800"},"337":{"terms":[{"id":5,"name":"Lifestyle"}],"title":"Absence makes the heart grow fonder","body":"<h1><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-size: 13px;\"><strong>Eliza Florendo, BeaconCorrespondent</strong></span></h1>\n<div>\n\nLong term and long distance relationships can be trickier than any corn maze, Rubix cube, or 1,000-piece jigsaw puzzle. It’s hard to gauge whether long-term and long-distance relationships will last once school starts. Most students go back to school after a vacation, and realize the harsh truth – they won’t see their boyfriend or girlfriend until the next break. With 80% of Emerson’s students from out of state, many of us leave our loved ones back at home. |\n\nStill, some lucky Emersonians have found a way to make staying in touch with their sweethearts work. Out of 100 students asked, 23 of them claimed to be in long-term and long-distance relationships.\n\nMegan Donovan, a print journalism junior, has been with her boyfriend, Mitch Paster, for three years now. Donovan said that little things like “random calls when he’s walking to and from the subway” show her that he cares. She said that their sweetest moment happened two years ago, when Paster flew from Florida to Boston and surprised her late on Valentine’s Day. For Donovan and Paster, staying together is easier because they see each other every two or three weeks, she said.\n\nFor other couples, trips to see their significant other aren’t so frequent. Dan Anderson, a freshman acting major, and Emily Richardi, high school senior, have been together for 10 months. Anderson said that the most difficult part about being in a long-distance relationship is only seeing Richardi for a couple of days every few months. “After a while it feels like she isn’t real and I’m going crazy talking to my phone or a computer screen,” Anderson said.\n\nHowever, Anderson found a way to make up for lost time, and seemingly endless Skype sessions, by having a late Valentine’s Day celebration when he can find a way to visit. “I’ll send her flowers and a card and things like that,” he said.\n\nAnderson said that one of the sweetest things the couple has done is creating a bucket list, including a picnic at a playground, a water balloon fight, stargazing, making pumpkin bread, having a camp out, and making s’mores.\n\n“It’s actually been really good because we don’t see each other all the time,” Anderson said. “So when I go home, it’s freaking awesome. It’s like a new thing. Whenever you get in a relationship there’s always that first month when you’re so happy. And it’s like that all the time.”\n\nJeremy Miller, a film production freshman, and his boyfriend of seven months, Brian Parker, who attends Champlain College, also found arranging dates for special occasions difficult. Miller made it work by giving Parker an Emerson bear as a memento of “Jer Bear” while he was away at school for their anniversary. Miller said that the sweetest thing that Parker ever did, was make him a giant poster of pictures and quotes encompassing all of their memories together last summer. “We spent the whole summer together and I thought to myself, how could I ever let this go?” Miller said.\n\nThough there is no sort of secret formula to keep the interest alive, Donovan’s formula works for her and Paster. “We want to take it day to day,” she said. “We enjoy each other that much, and we think that being together outweighs not being together. It outweighs all the questions in our head about everything.”\n\nSimilarly, Anderson claims that “If you think it doesn’t work then you just haven’t found a person that makes you want it to work. It’s not easy by any means but I think about what it would be like if we weren’t together, and it all becomes worth it.”\n\n</div>\n&nbsp;","dt":"2011-02-10 02:15:32 -0800"},"344":{"terms":[{"id":12,"name":"Auntie Em"},{"id":5,"name":"Lifestyle"}],"title":"Witness Protection","body":"Dear Auntie Em,\n\nLast weekend, I had sex with a girl who lives in my building.

Starting with students admitted for the fall of 2009, the college’s housing policy requires Emersonians to live on-campus through their junior year.\n\nLast week Amanda Turnley, the college’s housing operations coordinator, said last week the school now requires students to live on campus longer in order to fill its 1,935 beds. Depending on how many freshmen and sophomores move in next year, she said, some juniors will be permitted to live off campus. Turnley said rising juniors can apply to move off campus and will be selected via a lottery system.\n\nFor the $12,881 per year the college charges students to live and eat on campus, Eaton said she would rather live in an apartment on her own.\n\nWhile the information regarding the new policy was public to the class of 2013 prior to admittance, Eaton said she was not aware of it until she received the information in her mailbox.\n\n“I’m not gonna pay the money for something I can get for cheaper and better somewhere else,” the first-semester junior said. “Because of the cost of housing at Emerson I’ve been looking at single apartments which would be cheaper than living in a double or triple dorm room. I have friends who live on Commonwealth who pay the same amount as I do, which is ridiculous.”\n\nFor freshman Lindsey Train, part of the allure of Emerson was getting to live in the city of Boston.\n\n“Part of the reason I chose to come to Emerson was to experience the city of Boston,” the journalism major said. “Learning to maintain a home is a vital part of ones’ college experience; I want a place to call my own.”\n\nAt nearby schools like Boston University and Suffolk University, students can move off campus sophomore year or earlier, according to offcials at those universities.\n\nBoston University has a similar policy to Suffolk, though they require freshman to live on campus and have the accommodations to house 11,500 students, roughly 35 percent of their entire student population, Marc Robillard, BU’s director of housing, said in an e-mail.\n\nSuffolk University operates their housing on a first-come, first-served basis, with on-campus housing optional for only freshman and sophomores, with no mandatory requirements in place. According to an e-mail from Jeff Morris, ambassador of off-campus housing at Suffolk, only 25 percent of students live on campus.\n\nDerek Anderson, a junior at Suffolk University who transferred from Emerson after his freshman year, said Emerson’s new requirement is unfair, considering the $12,881 room and board cost.\n\n“[By] junior year you become a lot more independent from school, and being forced to live on campus would kind of mess with that vibe,” he said. “It’s a way of keeping students paying the school instead of landlords.”\n\nProspective students have taken notice as well, stating that housing requirements play a somewhat significant role in choosing which college to attend.  Dylan Stein, a high school senior considering going to Emerson, said housing is a legitimate factor in his search for the ideal school, and sees the three-year requirement as a turn-off.\n\n“There’s a good chance this could significantly impact my decision. I wouldn’t want to live on campus for three years,” said the prospective film major. “My sister goes to BU, and she moved out of the dorms her sophomore year.

Noonan said the man appeared to be intoxicated.  Noonan said “Ryan” was let go because he did not commit an actual crime, but said the issue immediately concerned him.\n\n“On a scale of one to 10 on what could go wrong on a college campus, this would be number one,” Noonan said, his office table covered with reports on the situation. “But as for the outcome, this is the best way it could happen. Nobody was hurt.”\n\nAfter reviewing security tapes from that night, Noonan said that the 25-year-old was leaning against the barrier across the security desk as a group of 10 to 12 students tapped their identification cards to enter the building.\n\n“He seemed calm, looking at people, reaching for his pockets, and staring at the security tap for whatever reason,” Noonan said, after spending the previous 24 hours at work investigating. “Then the Securitas officer got up and left, and they actually brushed shoulders with each other as she was leaving and he went in. So now, he’s in the building.”\n\nNoonan said “Ryan” was in the dormitory for approximately 27 minutes, according to the tapes. He said just three minutes before he entered, Officers Linscott and Rivera left Piano Row after a regular checkup, allowing them to return to the scene after the call was made within minutes.\n\nNoonan said that he plans to speak with the Securitas officer, who will no longer be working at Emerson College and will be placed elsewhere by her supervisor.\n\n“The tape shows the Securitas officer making a bad decision leaving her post,” Noonan said. “She was gone for about a minute, but you know what? A lot can happen in one minute.”\n\nNoonan said he met with the Securitas account manager for Emerson, and set a list of 10 goals to further campus security. The first goal includes choosing the top eight Securitas officers to remain at post in the dormitories, as well as a few backup. Noonan said these officers would have to attend extra training for the security of the residents.\n\nNoonan said that other measures include showing all officers that they are being taped, conduct audits a few times each semester, and give all workers an Emerson swipe card that they have to tap when they come to and leave their post.\n\nIn his almost six years at Emerson, Noonan said this is third time someone has been able to infiltrate a college building.\n\n</div>","dt":"2011-02-03 03:57:59 -0800"},"362":{"terms":[{"id":6,"name":"News"}],"title":"Angela Davis to speak at EBONI event","body":"<!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 15.0px Arial} p.p2 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 16.0px Times; min-height: 19.0px} --><strong>Xakota Espinoza, Beacon Staff</strong>\n\nAngela Davis, the famed Black Panther and communist activist, will speak at the Semel Theater on Wednesday, Feb. 16 as the headlining event for African American Heritage Month.\n\nThe college’s African American Heritage Month is lead by Emerson’s Black Organization with Natural Interests [EBONI] and Multicultural Student Affairs Director Tikesha Morgan.\n\nEBONI president Chris Hyacinthe said that Davis’ name has been mentioned by past EBONI leaders, and after sitting down with Morgan to choose a speaker for this year, they decided to finally go ahead and ask.\n\nHyacinthe said he sees hosting Davis as one of the biggest events EBONI has held during his time at Emerson.\n\n“I never thought I’d be meeting with Angela Davis, let alone introducing her,” the junior marketing major said. “It’s a pretty big deal; I’ll remember this.”\n\nHyacinthe said the decision was approved by EBONI’s executive board along with Tikesha Morgan.\n\n“It was a big deal for us to get her,” said Morgan in a Feb. 1 <em>Emerson Today</em> article. “She’s known for being a female Black Panther during the 1970s, and for questioning whether the prison system is working.”\n\nAccording to Hyacinthe, the cost of having Davis speak at Emerson is $15,000, but he believes it’s worth it, as she played such an instrumental role in African American History.\n\n“She [Davis] came into the Civil Rights Movement as it was dying down and that era was fading out; she came in with a more aggressive approach in looking for equal rights for everyone,” said Hyacinthe. “She had a different tactic in looking for the same goals that Dr. King and many others had during the 60s.”\n\nThe Angela Davis reception and book-signing is open to the entire Emerson community, who Hyacinthe strongly encourages to attend.\n\n“It’s a significant event, people should really pay attention to what she has to say; she brings a different perspective, and can make you think about something differently than you had before,” Hyacinthe said. “She brings a totally different outlook to Emerson.

When he first started the boys high school volleyball program at Mount Saint Charles Academy in Rhode Island, the team didn’t win a single game.\n“We got swept in every single match,” Letourneau said of the team’s first season.\nBut, Letourneau said, the players’ spirits weren’t defeated.\n“The following year, every single one of those players came back ready to go,” he said.\nTwo years later, Letourneau’s high school players were undefeated state champions.\nAnd Letourneau brought that experience with him when he was hired to expand Emerson’s volleyball program.\nSteve Selnick, a junior broadcast journalism major, has been playing since the inception of the men’s program three years ago.\n“[Letourneau] definitely knows how to build a team,” Selnick said. “He really knows how to motivate the players.”\nBefore Letourneau was hired, the women’s team had never surpassed the quarter-finals, and there was no men’s program.\nNow, Emerson Volleyball is an inclusive program in which both the men’s and women’s teams have been contenders in the Great Northeast Athletic Conference playoffs each year.\nLetourneau described the Mount Saint Charles Academy team’s turn around as his proudest coaching moment and said he felt similar pride again in 2009 when the Emerson women’s volleyball team made the GNAC championship.\n“The women worked so hard to get to that point,” Letourneau said.\nLetourneau said he’s been involved in athletics since he was a child, and wants his teams to feel like a big family.\n“My dad was a coach, so I’m a coach’s son,” he explained. “I love the relationships in sports.”\nLetourneau said he wants his players to depend on him and on one another.\n“They know I’m going to respect them and care for them and do whatever I can for them, and in turn they’ll do the same for me.”\nFormer rival coach Chris Wright said he is impressed by the team’s sense of unity.\n“They back each other up when someone is down,” said Wright, who was volleyball coach at Emmanuel College and worked in Emerson’s admission office when Letourneau was hired.\nThough Wright no longer coaches at Emmanuel, he is an associate director and coordinator of multicultural recruitment at Emerson.\nEven early in the program, Wright said, the Lions were strong against Emmanuel’s more mature program.\n“They have a great camaraderie on and off the court,” Wright said. “For such a short program, that was a heck of an accomplishment.”\nRecently, Wright said he enjoyed sitting in on a men’s volleyball practice, where he watched Letourneau use scenarios to prepare the team for an upcoming game.\n“I love the conditioning that the guys have to go through,” he said. “[Letourneau] impacts the players’ volleyball I.Q.”\nWright said any rivalry between the two has faded  and he even made an appearance as a guest coach at one of Letourneau’s practices.\nBut just because students aren’t on the volleyball team doesn’t mean they can’t train with Letourneau. He teaches an open workout class at the campus fitness center.\nLetourneau describes his circuit training class, which meets Mondays from 12:30-1:30 p.m.,  as a boot camp session in which participants learn to use their own body weight as resistance.\nBut when asked if he considers himself a bodybuilder, Letourneau laughed and said he doesn’t see himself that way.\n“I like fitness. I like to work out.”\nRather than solely focusing on winning, Letourneau said his main goal as a coach is to build a volleyball culture of players with perseverance who are compassionate in their daily lives.\nIf his players are good role models for his five-year-old son and three-year-old daughter, Letourneau said, he’s done his job.\n“Success on the court is great, but I want my kids to keep their noses clean.”</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Evan Sporer, assistant sports editor of the Beacon and member of the Emerson Volleyball team, did not edit this article.</span>\n\n</div>","dt":"2011-02-17 05:38:07 -0800"},"225":{"terms":[{"id":9,"name":"Sports"}],"title":"Defensive pressure, aggresive shooting propel Lions","body":"<div><strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Christopher Eyer, Beacon Correspondent</span></strong>&nbsp;\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Bilali Mack knows that for the Emerson offense to work at it’s best, the Lions’ premiere three-point shooters, Carlos Negrete and Tom Messinger, need to have open looks at the basket.\nAnd for that to happen, Mack and his teammates need to do the opposite — drive the lane.\n“The only way for us to spread the court and get shots for Tommy and [Carlos] is to backcourt cut and to attack,” said Mack. “Once they start making the threes, it makes it even easier for us to score and opens up the whole offense.”\nBy dragging defenders down toward the basket with him, Mack leaves Messinger and Negrete out on the wings with minimal opposition. With the defense drawn inside, a quick pass out usually results in an open three-pointer. Messinger and Negrete have combined for  118 three’s this season.\nWhile in Saturday’s matchup versus Emmanuel College, Mack continued to dish out to his teammates beyond the arc — Messinger and Negrete each scored 17 points — he also created his own looks, keeping the Saints’ defense off-balance.\nMack finished with eight points, nearly all of them coming on baskets at the rim. That, combined with a smothering defense, led the Lions to a 79-72 victory.\n“We already knew from the last game that [Emmanuel] shot 11 percent from the three-point line,” interim head coach Lynn Ramage said. “They shot 30 percent from the floor. We knew if we could keep them out of the driving lane, we would have a good chance to win the game.”\nThough the Saints were leading by four at the 18-minute mark, it would prove to be Emmanuel’s largest lead of the night, as Emerson quickly surpassed them, led by Mack.\nStarting in the middle of the first half, Mack continually drove to the basket. On two separate occasions, he was fouled but still made the basket and the free-throw to convert them into three-point plays. These penetrating plays opened up the court for the three-point shooters Negrete and Messinger to pump up the Emerson home crowd.\nIn the second half, Alex Dempsey picked up where Mack left off. The junior guard used his moves in the post to score 12 points in just 16 minutes of playing time. Down the stretch, Dempsey scored on a layup while being fouled. He made the free throw to put Emerson ahead by 11, its largest lead of the night.\n“They started getting comfortable and started to press us,” Mack said. “[Alex] came in in the second half and he started attacking to put the pressure on them. He broke their press and started going to the basket, and at the end [of the game] we only had to do time management.”\nOn the defensive end, the Lions held Emmanuel to 16 percent shooting from three-point range. Junior guard Drew Venter had four steals, including an outright strip from Saints’ point guard D.J. Fazio to stifle a late-game rally.\n“The overlying theme in every huddle today was defense,” said Venter, who is studying broadcast journalism. “We know we can score with any team in the league. I think [our defense] finally clicked today, and we got back to Emerson basketball.”\nVenter has been a force on defense all year for the Lions. He leads the team in steals with 46 and has grabbed 129 rebounds.\nOne area where the Lions  struggled was on the defensive glass. Saints’ center Theo Robinson grabbed six offensive rebounds, and Emmanuel had 14 second-chance points. In addition, Saints’ guard Xavier Everson dropped 25 points, at times proving too much for Messinger, who recorded his three personal fouls in the first half.\nEmmanuel attempted to use Emerson’s strong play and stage a comeback in the final minute, but poor shot-clock management and a late turnover by Fazio sealed the Saints’ fate.\nRamage, who took over as the interim coach Jan. 31, said he was pleased with the effort his players made, and also praised his assistant coaches Mike Sheffler and Bruce Seals.\n“The credit goes to my assistants for breaking this game down. I’m the new guy on the block and relying a lot on these guys to tell me the tendencies, what these teams do and don’t do,” he said. “I think this is a much needed win for these kids. They really work hard and no one deserves it more than they do.”</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Gabe Souza and Evan Sporer, Beacon staff, contributed to this report.</span>\n\n</div>","dt":"2011-02-17 05:39:15 -0800"},"226":{"terms":[{"id":9,"name":"Sports"}],"title":"BC bags bragging rights with Beanpot championship","body":"<div><strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Evan Sporer and Gabe Souza, Beacon Staff</span></strong></div>\n<div><strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\n</span></strong></div>\n<div><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> Thousands of students in the upper deck of the TD Garden rose to their feet Monday night, breathless after two hours of screaming chants at their counterparts.</span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> No one expected Northeastern University to even contend with the Boston College Eagles, the No. 1 ranked team in college hockey and defending national champion. This was unfamiliar territory for the Huskies.\nWhen three periods of hockey had ended, the team from Commonwealth Avenue found themselves in a 6-6 tie with the Chestnut Hill elite. A sudden-death overtime would be necessary to decide Boston bragging rights.</span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> “I said to myself after the third period, it is a shame that somebody has to lose this,” said Greg Cronin, Northeastern’s head coach. “If somebody came in here and bought tickets, they got every penny’s worth of their money.”</span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> Sean Legnini, Northeastern senior and coach of Emerson’s club hockey team, agreed.</span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> “It was a great game and it was good to see Northeastern play hard against a good team,” said Legnini, who watched the game on television. “I have a lot of friends at Northeastern who have never watched hockey before, but they went and were really excited about the Beanpot. It definitely matters to the schools and is a big part of Boston.”</span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> The sea of black and red Husky fans worked to a crescendo, the underdogs gaining momentum as they taunted BC goalie John Muse. On the other side of the Garden, the infamous BC Super Fans, decked in maroon and gold, returned the favor, and overtime began.</span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> BC’s Chris Kreider had already scored two goals and was poised to complete the hat trick six minutes into overtime as he let loose a one-timer.  But in one of Boston’s biggest college hockey games, it was a hometown kid who clinched the win.</span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> As Kreider’s shot flew wide right, it settled on the stick of Dorchester native Jimmy Hayes.\nThe junior from South Boston stashed the puck into the back of the net, giving the Eagles their second consecutive Beanpot trophy with a 7-6 win.</span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> “This is our Stanley Cup,” yelled Hayes, as he hoisted the Beanpot trophy into the air during the postgame celebration on the ice.</span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> “I’m not sure where [the goal] ranks [in my career].

That is what we strive for.”</span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> BC defeated archrival Boston University last week in overtime, 3-2, to advance to the finals. But, as head coach Jerry York explained, nothing was guaranteed.</span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> “Each game is different,” York said. “You try to prepare for what the 60 minutes is going to bring, but this one had some unusual twists in it. College hockey is a strange beast.”</span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> The 13 goals were the most in a Beanpot final since 1996. BC’s Tommy Cross, who scored the overtime winner versus BU, started the scoring by tallying an eerily similar goal to last week’s winner.</span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> Cross threw a shot from the point towards the net that ticked off a Husky defenseman and past goaltender Rawlings, who was in no position to make a save.</span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> After defenseman Luke Eibler found the back of the net with 2:54 left in the first period, Rob Dongara reclaimed the lead for Northeastern with a highlight reel goal in the second.</span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> Skating shorthanded, Dongara put the puck on his backhand, neatly slid it through the legs of an Eagle defenseman, and snapped a forehand shot to the top right corner.</span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> Kreider, who was named the tournament MVP, tied the game three minutes later with one of his two goals on the game.</span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> The sophomore forward was the 19th overall pick of the New York Rangers in the 2009 National Hockey League entry draft, but has yet to make the jump to professional hockey.</span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> Kreider isn’t the only NHL-committed player taking part in the Beanpot.

But we’re going to have ours too.”\nAfter senior Kathy Andrade battled her way to the rim, scored a basket, and made a free-throw, Norton hit another one of her four three-pointers of the night.\nThe suddenly-intense Lions closed out the first half on an 8-0 run to shrink the deficit to four.\n“Even when we got down, it wasn’t about trying to score 12 points on the next possession,” Gould said. “It was just about ‘let’s get two, let’s get two’ and then just focus on what we’re trying to do.”\nGould said he tried to stress to his team at halftime that they were in much better shape than Suffolk’s 32-28 lead indicated.\nThe Rams started the second half with a full-court press, but a three-pointer by sophomore guard Olivia DiNucci and poor shooting by Suffolk sparked a 17-0 run for the Lions.\nConnors said fatigue seemed to be an issue for Suffolk’s starting five, perhaps due to their up-tempo style of play in the first half.\n“We definitely outworked them [in the second half],” Connors said. “We wanted it way more than them. They had gotten too comfortable.”\nSuffolk only shot 28 percent in the second half, while the Lions went 16-for-18 from the free-throw line down the stretch to secure the lead and ice the game.\nEmerson closed the gap in the GNAC standings by improving to 7-3 in conference play, while Suffolk fell to 8-2.\n“It feels great. It feels awesome, especially playing as explosive as I did,” Norton said of the win. “But we still have two games left [before the GNAC tournament], so we just have to make sure we keep the momentum going into the next game.”\nNorton said she still hangs out with her former Suffolk teammates, making the win that much more enjoyable.\n“I liked Suffolk, but I guess Emerson’s just that much better.”</span>\n\n</div>","dt":"2011-02-17 05:42:38 -0800"},"228":{"terms":[{"id":7,"name":"Opinion"}],"title":"A transfer’s troubles","body":"<div><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Tom Carroll</strong>, <strong>Beacon Contributor</strong></span>&nbsp;\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Over the past three weeks, we watched millions of Egyptians struggle against their government in a quest for democracy.\nOn Feb. 11, protesters celebrated as Hosni Mubarak resigned his post and handed power over to the military. The Huffington Post declared the people’s revolution in Egypt a “success.” But while there is cause for jubilation, it is ill-premised to consider that a revolt is all that is needed to birth a democracy.\nEgypt’s military, now the governing power, vowed a transition to democracy “as soon as possible,” according to an article in Saturday’s New York Times.\nThe military assured that all existing international treaties would be honored during this phase. This allows Israel and Saudi Arabia to breathe a sigh of relief.\nStill, the Middle East remains a precarious place as nearby countries succumb to waves of protests against autocratic governments.\nThe U.S. has worked to spread democracy for decades. But we have proven to be masters of masking idealism with capitalist interests. Students are right to be skeptical of the Obama Administration’s vocal support for Egypt’s transition into peaceful democracy. The United States generally favors pragmatism over idealism. We proclaim to have an allegiance to universal democracy, but our behavior follows our business interests.\nWe have seen this in our relationship with China and our ongoing dialogue concerning human rights. We urge China to allow its citizen’s the freedom of speech and to release dissidents like Liu Xiaobo, but in the end, economic interests prevail.\nAmerican officials have sat down with opposition parties of questionable Western loyalties. Their primary concern has been the Muslim Brotherhood and gauging its anti-Israeli sentiments. The Muslim Brotherhood is Egypt’s most powerful non-governmental opposition party in Egypt. It currently seeks to be a legitimate party within the future parliament but does not seek to field a presidential candidate. Even if the Brotherhood did want a shot at power, only 15 percent of Egyptians would actually vote for the Brotherhood during elections.\nNews outlets in America have continued to sell the improbable scenario in which the Muslim Brotherhood and religious extremists take power in Egypt. But according to Tuesday’s New York Times, a panel of jurists have been appointed to revise Egypt’s constitution, including Sobhi Saleh, a legal expert for the Brotherhood. Another member, Maher Samy Youssef, will be representing Coptic Christians.\nThese two appointments seem to imply Egypt’s military and intellectuals are willing to put aside their religious differences in order to pursue a freer state.\nThroughout the 18 day conflict, there were reports of Christians allowing Muslims into their homes to pray in safety from the surrounding chaos. Religious differences were forgotten by the universal need for bread on the table and the right to speak freely.\nBut media outlets sell the prospect of sectarian violence to disguise the true motive for U.S. hesitation: Its economic agenda.\nSo how is the United States backing expediency? The U.S. has donated $2 billion a year in military aid to Egypt since 1979, according to ProPublica, a nonprofit news organization. In return, Egypt exports 89,000 barrels of crude oil a day, while also operating and owning the Suez Canal.  Roughly 2.4 million barrels travel through the canal each day, making each of the 19.4 million barrels the U.S. consumes that much easier.\nDo the math. Would it be in the United States’ interest to allow conflict to erupt and gamble with the ownership of the Suez canal? There is a lot of money invested in Egypt. The market value of corporations based in Egypt is listed at over $90 billion, according to Arabian Construction Week . Money speaks volumes, and the U.S. grows more tense as our gallons of gas become more expensive.\nOf course, this doesn’t matter to the Egyptian poor, who take up 44 percent of the population. We support their quest for social freedom and employment. But we are wary of their anti-Israeli sentiment and the consequences recent events may have on oil imports.\nWe must choose to either honor their quest for democracy or continue forward in our own best interests.</span>\n\n</div>","dt":"2011-02-17 05:45:35 -0800"},"229":{"terms":[{"id":3,"name":"Arts &amp; Entertainment"}],"title":"Bob’s Burgers serves up originality on Fox","body":"<div>\n<p id=\"internal-source-marker_0.006374761462211609\"><strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Daniel Fidler, Beacon Correspondent</span></strong></p>\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Just four episodes into its debut season, Bob’s Burgers is the best show in Fox’s Sunday night “Animation Domination,” and the only one that wasn’t created by Seth MacFarlane or called The Simpsons.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">While The Simpsons is a decade past its prime — with occasional moments of genius — and Family Guy, American Dad!, and The Cleveland Show are at this point rarely amusing, Burgers has infused the lineup with fresh blood. Like its predecessors, Burgers is a family comedy.  However, it is just as interested in examining the workplace as it is the living room.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Created by Massachusetts native Loren Bouchard (Home Movies and Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist), Burgers centers around the slovenly and omni-aproned Bob Belcher, the proprietor of the titular shack. Constantly driven crazy by his dysfunctional family, he does the best he can to run the ramshackle patty joint on the New England seaside. If the stoves aren’t failing downstairs, his intolerable brood is wreaking havoc in their apartment upstairs.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">In the second episode, entitled “Crawl Space,” Bob is forced by his wife Tina to go up to the attic to fix a leak in the roof before her parents come to visit. Bob, who is not very fond of his mother-in-law (“I don’t hate her, just the sound she makes”), decides to pretend he is stuck in the attic’s crawlspace when she arrives.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Hilarity ensues as his children take advantage of this opportunity to tease him and the situation escalates: Bob is soon stuck for real. He finds that while he can’t get out, he can walk around the house inside the walls.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">H. Jon Benjamin, who grew up in the Boston area, voices Bob.  Just like his performance as Sterling Archer in FX’s supremely funny spy comedy Archer, Benjamin steals every scene he’s in.  In “Crawl Space”  he loses his mind within the walls, encountering characters and experiencing scenes from The Shining, such as when he befriends one of his daughter’s nightlights.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Bob grows annoyed at his son Gene’s unyielding insistence that Salman Rushdie (of The Satanic Verses fame) wrote The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, defends his right to be trapped (“There’s nothing wrong with a man enjoying his crawl space!”), and calls his wife “Nagatha Christie.”</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">The show’s irreverent brand of humor continues behind the scenes: Tina and 12-year-old daughter Linda are both voiced by male comics, Dan Mintz and John Roberts. The funniest gag is they don’t even attempt to give their characters feminine voices.  Linda is an odd, socially awkward duck, prone to dreams of zombies making out and other more typical teenage issues.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Bay State comedian Eugene Mirman voices the son Gene, who walks around making flatulent noises on his keytar at all the wrong moments.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">The sole female cast member, Kristen Schaal, of Flight of the Conchords and The Daily Show fame, brings mischievous energy to the 8-year-old Louise, who will yell “fire” in a crowded theater just to be funny.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">The humor is not for everyone, however, as the pilot episode has Bob’s children riffing on child molestation, rashy genitals, and autism, all in the first 10 minutes. After that, though, the worst is behind you.  If you can stomach the weekly vomiting session of MacFarlane’s oeuvre, then you can handle Bob’s occasional lapses into amateur hour.  You may just consider it a breath of fresh air in comparison.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">The storylines in these four episodes haven’t been particularly original, but the neat animation style, which is like a descendant of Dr. Katz’s Squiggle Vision, and the fantastic voice cast make it worth watching.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Burgers debuted to about 10 million viewers, which is a pretty solid showing these days for network television, and has held up well in its subsequent airings, so it may not be one of those one-and-done shows that Fox is unfortunately so used to (Lone Star, we hardly knew ye). Catch up with the first quartet on Hulu, and tune in Sundays at 8:30 p.m. for new episodes.</span>\n\n</div>","dt":"2011-02-17 06:12:18 -0800"},"230":{"terms":[{"id":3,"name":"Arts &amp; Entertainment"}],"title":"Professor’s daughter contender in 2011 Oscar race","body":"[caption id=\"attachment_242\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"195\" caption=\"Photo Courtesy of Sarah Nesson \"]<a href=\"http://www.berkeleybeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/saranessononline.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-242\" title=\"saranessononline\" src=\"http://www.berkeleybeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/saranessononline-195x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"195\" height=\"300\" /></a>[/caption]\n\n<strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Ryan Mazie, Beacon Correspondent</span></strong>\n<div>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Unexpected phone calls can be nerve-racking. Filmmaker Sara Nesson, daughter of adjunct Emerson professor Bob Nesson, was in her kitchen when she received that phone call from her HBO film editor. The news was fantastic. She had been nominated for an Academy Award.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">“I was like ‘what?’” said Nesson over an exclusive phone interview with the Beacon. “I had to see it for myself so I kept refreshing the Academy website,  and when I saw my name come up it hit me. I started screaming, ‘I’m going to the Oscars!’”</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Nesson has been nominated for her first Oscar in the Documentary Short Subject category for her film Poster Girl — a chronicle of a cheerleader turned Iraq War sergeant. In the film, Robynn Murray comes back from the war facing Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and the red tape of Veteran Affairs.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Nesson found her subject in her own backyard of Burlington, Vt., the base of the Combat Paper Project. The organization helps soldiers turn their uniforms into paper, then embrace their military experiences through art. In Burlington, she met Drew Cameron, one of the project’s founders.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">“My dad had been working, trying to make a documentary about veterans and PTSD, but he wasn’t getting access to their raw feelings, because they were closed up,” said Nesson. She admitted to stereotyping veterans as silent about their experiences.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">“But the vets I met [at the Project studio] were different,” she said. “They really had something to say and wanted to be heard and express themselves emotionally.”</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">That’s when Nesson had a light-bulb moment — to chronicle the veterans at the Project and make it into a documentary. She followed five veterans at the Project for a film she intended to call Iraq Paper Scissors.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">“I was directing, shooting, sound, and editing on my own — I was literally a one woman crew,” said Nesson.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Knowing she needed help, she attended a producing workshop in Los Angeles with Mitchell Block. There, Block, who has a producer credit for Poster Girl, singled out Robynn Murray, who had previously graced the cover of Army magazine.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">He told Nesson, who had already shot everything, to restructure the film into a short documentary which could be submitted to HBO and the Academy.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">“He called it all, right then and there,” reminisced Nesson. “Just taking [the footage] to a seasoned filmmaker who has fresh eyes and can look at it from a different perspective was the best.”</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Titling the newly structured film Poster Girl, Nesson “wanted to personalize [the veterans’] stories and to get people to understand that these were individuals with real emotions and had to be heard.”</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Nesson, who is still in contact with Robynn, said that her film’s subject thinks her role is “very ironic.”</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">“She went from being the poster girl [for] women in combat to the face of PTSD,” Nesson said. “She’s serving this role with pride, and she knows she has a powerful voice and she’s taking that responsibility to represent others.”</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">The documentary inevitably delves into politics, but Nesson was “very conscious of keeping a balanced film.” Though the film highlights anti-war veterans, she thinks it “is about healing and redemption. Anyone who is pro-war or against war can relate to that.”</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Nesson’s own feelings on the war weren’t changed by her documentary. However, what did shift was her perspective on the military.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">“I thought people who joined the military went for gung-ho, macho reasons,” Nesson said, “but… a lot of these guys went for very altruistic reasons. They wanted to support humanitarian work; they wanted money for college.”</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Nesson, who graduated from the University of Vermont as an English and Art double major, was inspired to make movies by her father.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">“Growing up I would see him come home with stories and adventures,” said Nesson. “I was just so fascinated with his lifestyle.”</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">After initially dissuading his daughter from becoming a documentary filmmaker because it is a “hard and uncertain life,” Bob Nesson eventually supported her when she decided to follow in his footsteps. The two even worked together for a couple of years after Sara graduated college.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">“We made a really great team and I learned so much from him. We talk all the time and constantly [are] showing each other proposals, editing each others work, giving each other feedback.” As for now Sara said, “He says he is living vicariously through me with all of my new adventures.”</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Already reaping the benefits of an Academy-Award nomination, Nesson met one of her favorite actors, Geoffrey Rush. She said it feels “like [she’s] living someone else’s life for a brief period of time.”</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">However, Nesson is not taking this opportunity for granted. “I can’t expect everything to come to me. I still have to work really hard, and I’m planning on it.”</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">That hard work includes beginning the preliminary stages of a Hollywood feature narrative that will focus on the other female soldiers on the cover of Army magazine, which Robynn Murray graced, working with The Sting producer Tony Bill. After that project, though, she intends to take on lighter subjects in the future.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Calling the Oscar nomination “beyond my wildest dreams,” Nesson is looking forward to wearing the dress and celebrating with eight of her friends. “I’ve never been married, so this is sort of like my wedding,” she laughed.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">With her acceptance speech prepared, Nesson said that all of the nominees are allotted 45 seconds for thank-yous. Sara’s speech currently runs 13 seconds over. However, after whittling 80 hours of footage into a 38 minute film, cutting those few seconds shouldn’t be a problem.\nWatch for Poster Girl to tentatively air on HBO this fall. The Oscars air Sunday, Feb. 27.</span>\n\n</div>","dt":"2011-02-17 06:17:10 -0800"},"231":{"terms":[{"id":3,"name":"Arts &amp; Entertainment"}],"title":"Science on Screen expanding beyond the Coolidge  ","body":"<div>\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_233\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"200\" caption=\"Photo Courtesy of Coolidge Theatre\"]<a href=\"http://www.berkeleybeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Courtesy-of-Coolidge-Theatre.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-233\" title=\"Courtesy-of-Coolidge-Theatre\" src=\"http://www.berkeleybeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Courtesy-of-Coolidge-Theatre-200x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" /></a>[/caption]\n<p id=\"internal-source-marker_0.3914820677600801\"><strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Andrew Doerfler, Beacon Staff</span></strong></p>\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Some people use movies as an escape from the grind of real life. Fans of the Coolidge Corner Theatre’s Science on Screen project, however, prefer their cinema — both nonfiction and fiction — with a helping of research-backed reality.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">The Coolidge is now prepping the monthly series, started in 2005, for a nationwide expansion. Since its start in 2005, the program has presented movies preceded by explanations from area experts detailing the science that contributes to the film’s world — viewers of Fight Club learned of biological/anthropological reasoning behind masculine violence; fans of Full Metal Jacket discovered the scientific basis behind combat trauma.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Representatives from the Coolidge, with help from grant-making institution the Alfred P. Sloan foundation, launched their national initiative at this year’s Arthouse Convergence, an annual rendezvous of independent cinemas leading up to the Sundance Film Festival.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">The Coolidge, one of the Convergence’s founders, presented a plan to offer six to eight primer packages — including a complete list of the Coolidge’s past features and $7000 in seed money — for theaters hoping to start their own science-based film programs.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Interested theaters must turn in their applications by April 1 and the six to eight theaters chosen will be notified by June 1.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">The series has already proven its appeal in the Boston area. Coolidge Corner Theatre Foundation associate director and Science on Screen curator Elizabeth Taylor-Mead said that the program has been a success from its start, which she credits to creative and unexpected pairings.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">“The point of the series is that any film can be a departure point for a conversation about science,” Taylor-Mead said in a phone interview.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">George A. Romero’s zombie thriller Night of the Living Dead, for example, may seem completely fantastical. But a presentation from Harvard psychiatrist Steven C. Schlozman not only explained a neurobiological basis for the behavior of the undead, but also enthralled audiences with the humor and passion with which he delivered his lecture.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">“If he had talked for four hours, everyone would have been happy,” Taylor-Mead said.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">That particular screening’s influence extended beyond the walls of the Coolidge. After the enthusiastic response to his presentation, Dr. Scholzman went on to write a book on the subject: Zombie Autopsies: Secret Notebooks from the Apocalypse, due in March, compiles a collection of fictional “documents” from doctors attempting to cure a zombie pandemic. Now, according to Taylor-Mead, Dr. Schlozman has been talking with George Romero about working on a film.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Taylor-Mead hopes the concept can have a similar impact in communities across America. But the Coolidge isn’t looking to start a franchise for itself. Though it will provide a start-up kit — complete with a list of past features — to serve as a launchpad, each theater that comes aboard will design and run its own program.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Taylor-Mead believes that the Coolidge knows what works for Boston, but trusts that the individual theaters will best be able to discover what will be appealing to viewers from their own communities.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">But for now, the Coolidge continues to focus on its own program. To celebrate Valentine’s Day, on Feb. 21 the theater will screen Luchino Visconti’s 1971 adaptation of the Thomas Mann novella Death in Venice, which tells the story of a sickly writer’s obsession with an adolescent boy.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Harvard medical school psychologist Nancy Etcoff will precede the screening with a discussion on the hierarchy of physical beauty. If the Coolidge Corner Theatre still needed to convince hesitant viewers of science’s value in cinema, this might be the presentation to do it.</span>\n\n</div>","dt":"2011-02-17 06:19:20 -0800"},"232":{"terms":[{"id":3,"name":"Arts &amp; Entertainment"}],"title":"Hot New Shows on WECB ","body":"<div>\n<p id=\"internal-source-marker_0.11350357322953641\"><strong>Taylor Paul, Beacon Correspondent </strong></p>\n\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_239\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"150\" caption=\"Tim Strain/Beacon Staff\"]<a href=\"http://www.berkeleybeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Tim-Strain.jpg\"><img class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-239\" title=\"Tim-Strain\" src=\"http://www.berkeleybeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Tim-Strain-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_234\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"150\" caption=\"Photo Courtesy of Lasses with Glasses\"]<a href=\"http://www.berkeleybeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Courtesy-of-Lasses-with-Glasses.jpg\"><img class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-234\" title=\"Courtesy-of-Lasses-with-Glasses\" src=\"http://www.berkeleybeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Courtesy-of-Lasses-with-Glasses-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_235\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"150\" caption=\"Tim Strain/Beacon Staff\"]<a href=\"http://www.berkeleybeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Tim-Strain-4.jpg\"><img class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-235\" title=\"Tim-Strain-4\" src=\"http://www.berkeleybeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Tim-Strain-4-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_237\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"150\" caption=\"Tim Strain/Beacon Staff\"]<a href=\"http://www.berkeleybeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Tim-Strain3.jpg\"><img class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-237\" title=\"Tim-Strain3\" src=\"http://www.berkeleybeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Tim-Strain3-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_238\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"150\" caption=\"Tim Strain/Beacon Staff\"]<a href=\"http://www.berkeleybeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Tim-Strain2.jpg\"><img class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-238\" title=\"Tim-Strain2\" src=\"http://www.berkeleybeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Tim-Strain2-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>[/caption]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_241\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"150\" caption=\"Photo Courtesy of Get it On\"]<a href=\"http://www.berkeleybeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Courtesy-of-Get-it-On1.jpg\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><img class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-241\" title=\"Courtesy-of-Get-it-On\" src=\"http://www.berkeleybeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Courtesy-of-Get-it-On1-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></span></a>[/caption]\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\"> </span>\n\n<strong>\n</strong>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">That includes established programs looking to return as well as hoards of proposals for new shows.

Bittman says a listener voting system is forthcoming, but for now one host simply breaks the other down by the end of the show to declare a winner in their on-air culture war.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Your Music Sucks airs on Saturdays at 6 p.m.\nGet It On</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Get It On is one of WECB’s several new talk shows launching this semester. Arjun Singh and Connor Strader, a freshman film production major, share hosting duties on the late-night program. The hosts build each episode around an offbeat theme to decide which songs to play and topics to discuss.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">“Last week we did feral children,” says Singh, a print journalism major, “so we played songs by Wolfmother and talked about stories of us being crazy in our youth.”</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Get It On airs Saturdays at midnight.\nThe Man Cave</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Some of WECB’s other gab-fests are more gender focused, including The Man Cave, another late-night affair. Freshmen Jason Bornfriend, interactive media major; Kyle Brasseur, broadcast journalism major; and Luke Fraser, audio post-production major host the testosterone-fueled program, sharing topics ranging from sports to leggings.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">“One issue that comes up a lot is one of our co-hosts who is in a relationship and always gets himself into hot water,” says Bornfriend, who also serves as WECB’s events coordinator.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">“We’re more of a Howard Stern type of show,” Brasseur adds, “but without the STDs.”</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">The Man Cave airs Tuesdays at midnight.\nLasses with Glasses</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Women are equally represented on the schedule thanks to Lasses with Glasses. Juniors Kate Spalla, journalism major, and Sara Rubin, film production major, childhood friends since Girl Scouts, host the female-oriented talk and music program. Amidst the airtime given to women musicians and comedians, the girls delve into more serious matters.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">“Our banter can get pretty fun, but there are some important fem-issues to talk about,” says Spalla.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Lasses with Glasses airs Thursdays at 2 p.m.\nSam’s Bar Mitzvah</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Sam’s Bar Mitzvah looks to be the ultimate trip down memory lane for Emerson students.

No doubt, you’ve heard the infamous saying, “There are only two sure things in life: death and taxes,” and, not to be morose, but those are the two things that will always find a way to get you.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">One way to make this time of year look a little less gloomy is to be informed about how to file your taxes. </span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">You are only required to file a federal income tax return if you made more than $5,700 while single and not claimed on your parents’ return, or if you made more than $950 and you’re a dependent. If you worked last year, but made less than those amounts, and had federal taxes withheld from your paycheck, you may be entitled to that money.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">H&amp;R Block will do simple federal tax returns for free online, or at one of their walk-in locations, using either the 1040EZ, 1040, or 1040A form. These so-called “simple” returns are for people who don’t have a lot of deductions to claim.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">“A student could easily fill out a 1040 online if they have their W2 in front of them. The federal form is pretty straightforward,” said Rita Richmond, an agent at H&amp;R Block at 151 Tremont who has advised people on their taxes for 33 years.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Your employer should have given you your W2 at the beginning of this year. This form simply states the income of the past year and the amount withheld in federal taxes, social security, and Medicare.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Use these numbers to complete the “Income” section of the 1040EZ form. If you have any investments, like a savings account which yields interest, or if you own any stocks or bonds, you have to report the income from that too. Your bank, or your stock broker, will provide you with this information as well. If your income is less than the amount required to file, you may be eligible to get those withheld federal taxes back.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">If you made enough money and to file your taxes but forget to do so, you could get in trouble with the Internal Revenue Service.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">“They might send you a nasty letter,” said Richmond. “There is not a statute of limitations, so they are able to come after you for however many years after. If there is a mistake on your return, though, they have to notify you within three years.”</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">So don’t forget, your return must be postmarked by April 18.</span>\n\n&nbsp;","dt":"2011-02-17 04:26:21 -0800"},"262":{"terms":[{"id":5,"name":"Lifestyle"}],"title":"Give yourself some credit","body":"[caption id=\"attachment_266\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"150\" caption=\"Barbara Platts/Beacon Staff\"]<a href=\"http://www.berkeleybeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Barbara_Platts-Credit-Card-debt.jpg\"><img class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-266\" title=\"Barbara_Platts-Credit-Card-debt\" src=\"http://www.berkeleybeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Barbara_Platts-Credit-Card-debt-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>[/caption]\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">In a 2009 study conducted by Sallie Mae, 84 percent of undergraduates admitted the need for more financial management education. So get over that mild arithmophobia and educate yourself. Because while age can be just a number, a credit score, balance, and APR can not.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">College students have long been represented as carrying massive amounts of debt, especially those responsible for footing their own tuition bill. Most find that the easiest way to subsidize costs like books, food, and other supplies, is to put it on plastic.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Unfortunately, students are busy worrying about not failing out of school and forget to keep their finances in check. Some don’t know the terms of their credit cards and furthermore don’t know what those terms mean.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">“I know APR stands for Annual Percentage Rate, but I have no idea what my APR is,” said Jusmine Martin, a junior writing, literature and publishing and print journalism double major.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">APR could have a major impact on the actual cost of money spent. For example, according to credit.com, someone with a $5,000 balance with a 16% APR who makes a $125 payment each month would need 4.8 years and $2,000 in interest to pay off the balance.

Don’t remember him? Let us remind you: He finished fifth on Project Runway in 2005.\n\nSurely there is a less-expensive, more fashion-forward option out there. And surely someone on the Student Government Association would question this decision. But no one did.\n\nWe expected the SGA to question whether Verreos was a good fit — to debate the Fashion Society’s appeal like Michael Kors debates pencil skirts.\n\nBut members of the SGA ate up the Fashion Society’s $7,788.86 appeal faster than starved models at a pile of celery sticks.\n\nOnly one member bothered to ask a question — and it was about lighting, of all things. There was no debate of how this very expensive speaker would benefit the community or whether he was necessary for the event’s success. The SGA passed the appeal for almost $8,000 in fewer than 25 minutes.\n\nThis concerns us. Over the years, the Beacon has sat in on numerous SGA meetings.  We’ve watched countless student leaders sweat in front of SGA, begging for nickels to send another delegate to New York, or to purchase a few extra copies of their publication. Sometimes those pour souls stand up at the front of the room for an hour while dissenting SGA members pick them to pieces over $100 expenditures. And sometimes an organization gets a rubber stamp for $7,788.86 before you can stammer, “That’s fierce.”\n\nIt’s as though the SGA — like fashion — is in a constant state of fluxury. Apparently, in student government, one day something is in, and the next, it’s out.\n\nAs students, we’d like to trust SGA members to treat each appeal with the same level of seriousness and professionalism. They cannot vote on one appeal as Heidi Klum and the next as Nina Garcia. We hate that when appeals go this smoothly, we have to wonder if it was because a senator was the one presenting.\n\nInstead, we would love to see contemplative debate about every appeal. SGA, you have been entrusted with our money, and you should take that responsibility seriously. Frugality can’t come in and out of style as though it were a pair square-toed shoes. You should come to each meeting having done your homework — or at least having read the appeal — and plan to discuss each for a consistent period of time. Get your act together and “make it work.”\n\n&nbsp;","dt":"2011-02-10 23:10:26 -0800"},"339":{"terms":[{"id":5,"name":"Lifestyle"}],"title":"Mint.com: double your pleasure, double your cash","body":"<!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 15.0px Arial} p.p2 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; text-indent: 48.0px; font: 15.0px Arial} --><strong>Jamie Bogert, Beacon Staff</strong>\n\nWe’ve all been there: standing, nose-pressed against the glass of a store window, looking at the newest display of the hottest trends. The urge to take out that shiny, plastic card and swipe up every item on every rack is unbearably enticing.\n\nAs you return to your senses and peel your eyes away from the Gucci bag on sale for halfprice, you consider the other things you could be spending your nickels and pennies on.\n\nThese tempting feelings can be overwhelming at times, and many of us wish we could have a little angel and devil on our shoulders guiding us to buy the right thing. Luckily, there is a technological equivalent to those little imaginary people: Mint.com.\n\nMint assists you in making the best decisions for saving or even making money based on your individual purchase history. “I’m able to budget myself every month based on what money I’m getting,” said Ali Schmelzle, a freshman writing, literature, and publishing major. “I can see which places I spend money at; it breaks it all down for me.”\n\nThe tabs offer you choices such as transactions, budgets, goals, trends, and ways to save. “I found out I’m going to Kasteel Well next year, and with Mint, I’ve started a savings goal,” said Schmezle. “Without that kind of program, I don’t know if I’d be strict enough with my savings.”\n\nChris Mills, 21, a junior studying mechanical engineering and computer science at MIT, says he was really impressed with Mint’s ability to import information from financial institutions, attempt to categorize it, and analyze wise financial decisions for him based on his habits. “Add to that that they keep adding new features, like goals, investment accounts, partnerships with TurboTax, and more,” said Mills.\n\nCreated in 2005 by Aaron Patzer, the site has since been named the best free online personal finance tool by magazines such as <em>Money Magazine</em> and <em>PC Magazine</em>. Mint has been compared with other financial budgeting sites like Wesabe.com, Pennyminder, and Geezeo, ranking number one in 10 best options for a personal finance tool according to <em>U.S News</em>. Mint gains about 3,000 users every day, according to their site.\n\nLogging on and using Mint is as easy as spending money on the three grande caramel macchiato’s from Starbucks you got today. To start off, the site is free and it only takes about five minutes to set up your information. Mint does not require your address or social security number, and does not share your name. The only information you need to provide for the initial sign-up is your name and e-mail address. Many users find Mint’s commitment to privacy a huge plus. “Mint is a read-only site, you can’t transfer funds from your accounts through it, so it’s absolutely safe,” said Schmelzle.\n\nOnce you’ve become a member, you can explore the site on your own or click the “How It Works” tab found at the top of your screen. This helps guide you and provides resources such as informational videos like “How to add an account.” Mills says the accessibility of the site has made it a successful one. “Most financial software is really just downright depressing,” said Mills. “Mint almost makes it fun to look at your money, which makes it much easier to maintain.”\n\nTo gain a better understanding of what people are saying about Mint, check out MintLife, the site’s personal blog with everything on finances from “Frugal Living” to “Becoming Wealthy.” Even with everything Mint already provides for users, Mills says it’s still looking to improve. “They’ll continue to add features to their debt management system, increase robustness, support, and response time of their institution import features.”\n\nAnother new aspect that Mint may be adding to their site is transforming it into a transaction processor like PayPal. Processing transactions directly through Mint with your phone on the go would be convenient. By simply using a code texted to you by Mint, can authorize payment at the register or the soda machine and have the transaction immediately post to Mint, Mills said.\n\nMint offers plenty of help for the budgeting college student. Whether it’s the expense of taxis on the weekend, grocery shopping, or browsing the glitzy shops on Newbury Street, Mint is there to be the little angel on your shoulder, without making you look like a crazy person.\n\n&nbsp;","dt":"2011-02-17 02:18:33 -0800"},"343":{"terms":[{"id":12,"name":"Auntie Em"},{"id":5,"name":"Lifestyle"}],"title":"Bigfoot Problems","body":"<div>Dear Auntie Em,</div>\n<div>\n\nI’ve begun to develop a fungus on the bottom of my feet.

No longer will students fill out tedious paper forms in order to be placed in the housing lottery. The entire system has now moved online.\n\nAmanda Turnley, housing operations coordinator, and Beth MacEachin, associate director of operations, demonstrated the new online housing process at an information session Wednesday in the multipurpose room. The housing application is the same as it was last year, Turnley said, the only difference is that everything has moved to the web.\n\nStudents will use their ECnet username and password to enter the application. The first step is to agree to all the housing process guidelines.\n\n“This first step is really important,” MacEachin said. “By hitting agree, you are saying you will adhere to all the deadlines and the things that pertain to the process, particularly the March 14 deadline of applications and March 25 for students who receive an email regarding their status within the housing selection.”\n\nStudents can then begin the application by filling out a questionnaire and choosing their building preference. Floor plans will not be available online until the actual room selection process, which takes place from April 4 to 22.\n\nFor students wanting to live in a four, five, or six person suite, he/she needs to fill out the suite application specifying the residence hall and listing the ID numbers of the suite mates they want to live with. If students do not list ID numbers, the system will not make the match.\n\n“If one person in the suite does not correctly input those ID numbers, then we don’t know for sure that person wants to live with you,” said Turnley.\n\nThe next pages allow students to specify if they want to participate in a learning community or live in gender neutral housing. Only if a student wants to be part of these options do they fill out the page.\n\nTurnley and MacEachin said that just because a student applies to be in a suite, gender neutral housing, or live in a community learning environment does not mean they are guaranteed that placement.\n\nFinally, the last page is the housing contract. By completing the application and clicking agree, students will be placed into the housing selection lottery. What is different about the contract, Turnley said, is that because the board of trustees has not determined the cost of room and board for next year, examples are given of what the rates were for this year. Turnley said the updated cost will be available on the website later in the spring.\n\n“It should be in the same ball park as this year, but I can’t guarantee you what it will be,” Turnley said.\n\nTurnley said students can edit their application up until March 14, which is the deadline for submission, and will be emailed by March 21 informing them of their appointment time.

Students from all majors can apply for the course, which fulfills eight credits in writing, literature, and publishing. Carlson said applications are due Feb. 25, but depending on how many applications are sent in, the deadline may be cut to an earlier date.\n\n“This is the first time we’re doing it,” Carlson said in an interview. “At this point we’re really seeing if it is going to work. Is there enough student interest? Do people want to go?”\n\nThe trip will cost $7,999. That fee covers tuition for the two courses students will be taking, housing in a residence hall provided by the International Education of Students, students’ insurance, and theater tickets. Students must pay their way for airfare, travel expenses around London, meals, passports, and books.\n\nCarlson said her interest in modern British drama and early Shakespeare led her to create two classes blending these subjects.\n\nIn “Shakespeare and His Contemporaries,” students will read plays by Shakespeare and his dramatists and then attend those plays at theatres around London.\n\n“There were a bunch of shows that I went to [in London], and I just thought it would be kind of cool to do this with a group of students,” Carlson said.\n\nIn the second course, “London Theatre in Performance,” students will read and reenact plays being shown around London, both in the literary context and through performance. The performance past is what interests junior Linsday Day.\n\n“I’ve had two classes with Christina and she’s amazing. She inspired me to really get into Brit lit,” said the writing, literature, and publishing major. “When she started talking about this great program in London with her and a small group of people, I thought it would be amazing.”\n\nDay is still deciding whether or not to apply to the program because she is currently looking into other study abroad opportunities for this summer as well. According to Carlson, applicants will be accepted based on their academic year, what classes they have taken, GPA, and, most importantly, their reason for wanting to participate in the program.\n\n“I’m also going to conduct interviews. It’s about group dynamics and what their commitment to the program is,” she said.\n\nDavid Griffin, director of international study and external programs, said they have received 22 applications so far. If the program is a success, he said, they might make this a regular study abroad option.\n\n“I have no reason to see why we couldn’t continue to offer it. With the new president coming in, he is very interested in international education,” said Griffin. “So I don’t see why something like this wouldn’t continue.”\n\nCarlson said from speaking to students in her classes, there seems to be a lot of interest in the program.\n\n“I’m just really excited. As you can imagine, it’s a lot of effort to try and put it together,” she said.

So it’s only fitting that the 21-year-old junior has been a consistent force on the Emerson basketball team throughout its erratic and at times controversial season.\n\nAs Emerson’s floor general, Venter led the team in minutes, rebounds, assists, and steals while starting all 26 games at point guard.\n\nBut while Venter has become a fixture with the Lions, the junior hasn’t always experienced this much stability.\nVenter moved around frequently during his childhood. He lived in Allston, Brookline, Dorchester, Mattapan, Milton, and Roxbury under the custody of his mother before moving in with his father in Mansfield prior to his sophomore year of high school.\n\nVenter said his nomadic lifestyle had no effect on his ability to play basketball, but he admitted that it added another burden to the already difficult balancing act that a typical student-athlete endures.\n\n“Especially because of my situation, two households or whatever, it was hard. But I just had to get through it because that’s how we grew up,” he said. “We were never taught to feel sorry, and I guess that’s how I play on the court, really. You just get it done, and that’s one of the testaments to being a man, my father always said.”\n\nThis philosphy has been evident with the 5-foot-11 guard.\n\nAs a teen, Venter’s Amateur Athletic Union basketball team won back-to-back state championships. The guard traveled around the country and competed against talents such as Romeo Miller (Lil Romeo) and DeMar DeRozan, now an NBA guard for the Toronto Raptors and a participant in the 2011 NBA Dunk Contest.\nVenter’s college recruiting profile even appeared on ESPN’s website in 2008.\nThroughout the college search, Venter said his primary focus was on academics. Emerson was at the top of his list, the broadcast journalism major said,  because he strives to break into the sports entertainment field. But he said he was initially waitlisted. This forced him to seek other options, including Boston College, Boston University, and Northeastern.\nPatience paid off for Venter, though. He was admitted and came to Emerson in 2008, at which point he decided to continue his career on the hardwood.\nVenter quickly established a close relationship with former Emerson head coach Hank Smith, who he described as a motivator. He also formed a bond with former Lions captain and 1,000-point scorer Jeremy Shannon, who immediately took the newcomer under his wing.\n“[Shannon] was really accepting and he wanted to help me in getting started for basketball,” Venter said. “He was really friendly even though we played the same position, which was cool.”\nThe resulting friendship not only helped Emerson go 37-17 from 2008 to 2010, but also generated plenty of intense practice battles.\n“When it comes to him playing, he’s always going to play 100 percent,” said Shannon, who describes himself as a big brother to Venter. “The thing that stuck out to me was his defense. He always pushed me in practice. Whenever he would play me tough, though, I would say ‘don’t stop.’”\nAnd he hasn’t.\nVenter’s pass-first mentality and defensive prowess have earned him the confidence and trust of his teammates.\n“Coach [Smith] always drilled him in practice about how he wasn’t Jeremy [Shannon] and how he couldn’t do the things that Jeremy could,” teammate Nate Firn said. “But I wouldn’t trust anyone as much as Drew right now with the ball.”\nBut Venter’s road to prominence at Emerson hasn’t always been smooth.\nSeven games into his freshman season, Venter dislocated his shoulder against Emmanuel College while battling for a rebound. Exiting the Brown-Plofker Gym on a stretcher, Venter’s basketball future was uncertain. It was the seventh time that he had dislocated his shoulder, an injury that he says still sometimes hinders his range of motion and ability to work out.\nDespite the injury, though, Venter said his biggest obstacle came this season when his respected mentor Hank Smith vacated his position as the team’s head coach.\nWhen asked about his proudest moment as a player at Emerson, Venter said, “Being able to say I was coached by Coach Hank Smith, being in this era. Everybody who comes after can never experience that.”\nVenter also said he still can’t help but reflect from time to time on his 17-point effort versus Wheaton College during his freshman year, which he said made an early statement to Smith and the rest of the team.\nNow, he said, he tries to ignite the same passion in his teammates that Smith ignited in him.\n“I’d like to think [I’m a leader]. I don’t know what other people think of me, but you can’t live your life on the perspective of people who really don’t know you.”","dt":"2011-02-24 03:54:30 -0800"},"251":{"terms":[{"id":9,"name":"Sports"}],"title":"Turnovers, mistakes lead to early playoff exit for Lions","body":"[caption id=\"attachment_257\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"150\" caption=\"Gabe Souza/Beacon Staff\"]<a href=\"http://www.berkeleybeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Gabe_oliviaconnors_gabe_archive.jpg\"><img class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-257\" title=\"Gabe_oliviaconnors_gabe_archive\" src=\"http://www.berkeleybeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Gabe_oliviaconnors_gabe_archive-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>[/caption]\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Bad habits can reveal themselves at the worst times. Such was the case for the women’s basketball team Tuesday night, in its quarterfinal playoff matchup at St. Joseph’s College of Maine.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">So frequent were the turnovers and mental mistakes by the Lions, said head coach Bill Gould, he knew about four minutes into the game that his team’s chances of winning were slim.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">“It was at that point that I realized things just weren’t going well,” Gould said. “You see that look in the girls’ faces and you know it’s not good. After I called the first timeout it got worse, and that’s when I really knew.”</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Gould said his team couldn’t put an end to the mistakes. Open looks here, missed opportunities there, and Emerson soon found itself in a big hole.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">“Once the bad habits start, it just snowballs a bit and there’s nobody there to stop it,” Gould said. “We were down four and then all of the sudden I look up and we’re down 25. I know the other team can’t score 20 points in 30 seconds, but it felt that fast.”</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">By the end of the night the Lions had succumbed to the Monks, 69-48, ending Emerson’s season. </span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">St. Joseph’s will play Suffolk University tonight in the semi-final round of the Great Northeast Athletic Conference playoff tournament.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">“I think if you want to you can blame many things for the loss,” sophomore point guard Amy Sherman said. “You can say bus ride, you can say we’re tired, it’s a long season, we’re young, not used to college playoffs, but ultimately it just comes down to us as individuals and players and we didn’t step up. It’s no one’s fault but our own.”</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">For Sherman, the realization that playoff hope was slipping away came about 11 minutes before halftime.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">“I looked up at the scoreboard and realized that we had only scored seven points,” said Sherman, a communication studies major. “Seven points in nine minutes. And we had given up 30. That was really defeating.”</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">The Lions committed 17 turnovers in the game and shot just 4-for-27 from the field. In comparison, the Monks came out on fire, the players said, hitting 60 percent of their shots and taking a commanding 28-point lead before the half.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">“We started the game with too many turnovers and bad defensive sets that we weren’t rotating well in,” Sherman said. “It ended up with easy layups for them, essentially getting whatever they wanted.”</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Freshman forward Olivia Connors, a marketing communication major, said that in the Lions’ biggest game of the year, they reverted to their worst tendency.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">“All year I’ve been saying we’ve had a bad habit of falling down into a big hole at half time and having to claw our way back out in the second half,” said Connors in a phone interview with the Beacon. “And that’s exactly what happened. To me that was our biggest problem. We couldn’t avoid that.”</span>\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Connors said she became aware her team wasn’t going to advance in the tournament while she was in the locker room at half time.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">“I just looked and we were down by 30, and it was like ‘wow’,” Connors said. “All first half they kept getting consecutive layups and hitting shots. I’m still not sure exactly what happened. All we could do in the second half was to try and play for some pride.”</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Some of the mistakes subsided in the second half, Sherman said, and Emerson doubled its point total from the first.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">“We definitely came out stronger,” she said. “It’s just a hard thing to do, especially in that situation, knowing its one game and you’re out, and we put ourselves in a bad spot. We competed but at that point it was too little, too late.”</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">With just one senior on the team, Kathy Andrade, Gould said there simply wasn’t enough veteran leadership to correct lapses in judgment on the court.</span>\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">“I think what happened is exactly what we saw all year with all the youth and inexperience and not knowing how to react to the situation,” Gould said. “Instead of adapting to a situation, you panic and don’t know what to do.”</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">This season Gould started two freshman, two sophomores, and one senior — by far the youngest starting five in the GNAC.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">The Lions finished the regular season with a record of 9-17 overall, and 7-6 in the GNAC. And while the youthful mistakes and tough competition made for what the players and coach described as a disappointing season, both said they’re looking forward to what next year will bring.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">“In the immediacy of the moment, it absolutely sucked,” Gould said. “Usually you like to balance with a lot of veterans and some younger talent. But while we didn’t always execute perfectly, there were a lot of bright spots.

The last meeting resulted in a 67-49 Norwich loss in Boston.\n\nCrowding the middle of the floor on defense, Norwich left Emerson’s usually reliable three-point shooters open, allowing them to take uncontested shots, according to Emerson players.\n\nThis time, however, the players said the Cadets used what they saw against Emerson a mere two days prior, and put it to use.\n\nThe Lions said they had many open looks, but their normally potent long-distance scoring game fizzled — as did their season.\n\nIn a game in which Emerson shot a mere 4-for-30 from the three-point line, the Lions fell to Norwich, 62-44, ending their season.\n\n“If someone plays us [the way Norwich did], nine out of 10 times, they’re going to lose,” said interim head coach Lynn Ramage. “It was a carbon copy of [last] Saturday’s game. Only Norwich hit the shots. We didn’t.”\n\nRamage stressed that especially in the playoffs and on the road, the ability to make shots is the key to winning the game.\n“Shots weren’t falling,” said junior forward Carlos Negrete in a phone interview with the Beacon. “The rims weren’t kind to us today.”\n\nNegrete shot 34 percent from three this season, averaging the fourth most three-pointers per game in the GNAC. However, the junior was unable to convert any of his long-range attempts in the quarterfinal matchup, finishing the game 0-for-7.\n\nMuch of the Lions’ offense this season has been based on their ability to knock down long-range shots and stretch opposing defenses with their shooting threats.\n\nBut when it mattered most, in Tuesday’s single-elimination playoff game, the Lions simply could not put the ball in the basket.\n\nThe game started out slowly with neither team finding any offensive rhythm, said sophomore guard Bilali Mack.\n\n“No one was able to establish any presence offensively at the start,” Mack said in a phone interview. “[Norwich] hit a couple of threes in the middle of the first half, but our defense kept us in it.”\n\nIn the first half, the Lions shot 33 percent from the field, but only trailed by two points.\n\nMack said the Cadets began to push the ball on the fast break, and extended their lead by scoring quick buckets.\n\n“They started to build a lead,” Mack said. “It was six points. Then eight points. We just started reeling.”\n\nAnd while the Cadets began to find their offensive stride, the Lions were unable to muster any rhythm.\n\n“The offense wasn’t really flowing, we weren’t really able to move the ball around,” Mack said.\n\nAs Norwich continued to pull away, Emerson’s normally lethal three-point attack was abysmal. In the second half, the Lions shot 1-17 from three.\n\n“I tried to drive the ball to the rack a couple of times [in the second half] to find my rhthym,” said Negrete. “It just never worked.”\n\nNo solution seemed to work as the Cadets continued to widen the gap.\n\n“I always think that my shooters are going to hit shots,” Ramage said. “They clogged the middle and dared us to shoot, we just didn’t hit shots.”\n\nLate in the game, as a by-product of attempting to mount a comeback, Mack found himself on the bench with three fouls.\nAlso in foul trouble were Kabir Moss and Nathan Firn. Firn scored a team-high 15 points, but both players fouled out and were forced to watch the final moments from the bench. Firn shot 7-for-12 from the field while his teammates managed a combined 10-for-48.\n\nFresh off a victory over the Cadets just two days before in its senior game, Emerson had 48 hours to plan for its quarterfinal matchup. The team wasn’t able to execute most of what it worked on in practice.\n\n“We started switching [defensively] on the bottom on the big man to deny him the ball in the post,” Mack said.“We also put in an isolation play in for myself and for Kabir on the big man. It worked a couple of times for Kabir, but we just didn’t execute offensively.”\n\nDespite the outcome, the Lions said they were pleased with their effort.\n\n“Everyone played really hard, so there’s no reason to be disappointed,” said Negrete, who will get another shot to make a run at a GNAC championship next year as a senior. “Moving forward there’s going to be a lot of seniors next year, which helps. But that’s so far in the future. Everybody is taking it one day at a time right now.”","dt":"2011-02-24 03:59:38 -0800"},"268":{"terms":[{"id":7,"name":"Opinion"}],"title":"Examining race on campus: EBONI is ill-served by poster","body":"<strong>Soren Bliefnick,  <strong>Beacon Contributor</strong></strong>\n\n<strong> </strong>\n\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.berkeleybeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Define-Black1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-273\" title=\"Define-Black\" src=\"http://www.berkeleybeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Define-Black1-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>\n</strong>Tshembe, a character in Lorraine Hansberry’s play Les Blancs, identifies race as a device, a social construct used to divide people and justify certain behavior. Despite being a work of fiction, our concept of race and its pernicious effects nevertheless persist:  “I believe in the recognition of devices as devices,” Tshembe says, “but I also believe in the reality of those devices…And it is pointless to pretend that [racism] doesn’t exist­­ — merely because it is a lie.”\n\nIt’s true that issues surrounding race historically have been, and in some cases still are, tied to cultural hegemony or domination. I am not attempting to minimize that here.  But I do want to emphasize the way race is used as a device in Emerson’s Black Organization with Natural Interests’[EBONI] posters around campus. The posters advertise a month-long series of events in recognition of Black History Month, including the hosting of Angela Davis — no small feat.\n\nThe posters are also all over campus, and their title, “Definition: Black,” implies EBONI’s programs have the collective goal of delineating what it is or means to be black. I think is a befuddling and daunting task. Try defining whiteness. It’s not an easy task, either. But to suggest, as EBONI’s poster does, that blackness should be defined, or that it even can, seems to contradict the organization’s ostensible goals.\n\nTo define something is — in some ways — to restrict it. Something defined is only so by virtue of not being something else. Women are only such in the context of men; saying someone is young only makes sense in context of the old. Attempting to define black, then, is delimiting, saying, “You are only this, so you can’t be otherwise.”\n\nPointing to blackness (or whiteness) and calling it out as possessing certain characteristics constricts it.  It reasserts its function as a device. Generally, regardless of race, we can agree we want equal treatment on the basis of being human — why does this poster go on to say that being of a particular racial group means therefore being a certain way?  Does not that serve only to divide?\n\nOf course, we can’t just forget about race and joins hands and sing.  Race wil; still be there, however ugly, as a cultural and historical institution. EBONI’s programs might seek to celebrate American black heritage, but the poster’s rhetoric minimizes the potential of both the events and the people they celebrate by maintaining race as a device.\n\nThe posters are lined with pictures of Emersonians who look (but curiously, are not necessarily) black, and each picture has, for lack of a better term, a “positive” word underneath it.  Most of them are what one would expect. One picture is “vibrant,” another “creative,” “sexy,” etc.  (One which puzzles to no end is “presentation.”)  None of these words are misplaced, but I don’t think they pertain only to those who are black.  Someone who does not identify as black can also be “sexy.”  Perhaps the suggestion is that being black is all of these words and more, but that would make “Definition: Black” all the more confusing.\n\nI once met an Emerson student who believed the “four races of the world” were white, black, Hispanic, and Asian.  Perhaps you’re smirking, because it’s so obvious Thai and Korean cultures aren’t the same.  But they’re both Asian, aren’t they?  How about Italian and Welsh: They’re white — aren’t they the same?\n\nRace is somewhat ineffable. By titling its poster “Definition: Black,” EBONI not only sent the message that it was attempting something insolent, but also something nearly impossible. A more honest title would have read “Discussion: Black.”\n\n&nbsp;","dt":"2011-02-24 15:23:28 -0800"},"270":{"terms":[{"id":7,"name":"Opinion"}],"title":"Governor Patrick’s trip to Israel benefits the Bay State","body":"<strong> Channah Barkhordari, <strong>Beacon Contributor</strong></strong>\n\nIn the coming month, Mass. Governor Deval Patrick will be leaving the U.S. for what could be the most beneficial trade mission in the state’s recent years.\n\nAfter securing a second term in office, the governor isn’t wasting any time making good on his promise to travel more. He intends to visit the United Kingdom and Israel with a contingency of like-minded professionals and executives to showcase our state’s innovative companies and facilitate further commercial opportunities. According to an article this month in the Boston Herald, he planned to tour Israel for similar reasons in 2008, but postponed due to concerns over public demands that he keep a tight budget.\n\nHowever, as the state is now out of the recession, Patrick is making the wise choice to go through with his plans. Amid the turmoil shaking the surrounding region, Israel is taking the world on with its big ideas — and Patrick has noticed.\n\nThe Boston Globe reported Patrick is most interested in Israel’s prowess in life sciences and clean energy. Israel is a world leader in both areas and shares a close, integral partnership with the Bay State.\n\nBoston in particular benefits from a strong international partnership with Israel’s third-largest urban center, Haifa. Since 2004, the two have had an especially notable medical connection through the Boston-Haifa Life Sciences Initiative [BHLSI], a project of the Combined Jewish Philanthropies designed to promote the success of their collaboration in the field and their respective economies.\n\nThrough BHLSI, the Mass. powerhouse companies could broker careful investments in promising start-ups. The private institution’s support of Rcadia Medical Imaging Ltd., based in Haifa, led to the production of the lifesaving Computer Aided Diagnostics system, among other initiatives, and has created more job opportunities in both cities.\n\nSimilarly, the Technion in Haifa has been a source of several medical breakthroughs. The Technion has ties to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology through Hibur, an organization creating educational and professional platforms for students and faculty of the two premier technological institutes to network. By sharing a network of think tanks in the field of high-tech advancements and providing opportunities for students to spend time studying at their sister school, new information and innovation can encourage breakthroughs on both continents.\nBioDetect, for example, is a medical isolator of bacteria perfected at the Technion and used by major U.S. companies. A recently perfected drug developed by Teva delays Alzheimer’s disease and alleviates the effects of Parkinson’s disease for patients in our hospitals.\n\nGovernor Patrick is also set on creating renewable forms of energy production. As the governor intends to invest $2 billion over 3 years in energy efficiency programs, his ambitions need look no further than Israel. In the arena of environmental awareness and innovation, the 62-year-old state has become nothing short of a world wonder.\n\nSince Israel’s founding, the country has equipped over 90 percent of homes with solar-powered water heaters — more per capita than any other country in the world. In 2010, Shai Agassi, founder-CEO of Better Place, launched the first ever battery-operated fully electric car in conjunction with Renault-Nissan — paving the way for an entirely oil-independent Israel and a laying the foundation for a global gas-free automobile market. Most recently, Innowattech’s new asphalt-embedded technology also saw a major breakthrough in harnessing power from highways and railroads, converting a vehicle’s natural compression into electricity.\n\nThe Boston Israel Cleantech Alliance has been instrumental in serving as a link between the two cities’ electric sights, with a main goal of increasing Boston’s educational, economic, and technological relations with Israel. Dozens of academic departments, student organizations, private businesses, and investors of both cities are involved in the Alliance, including those at the Technion and MIT, as well as over 70 cleantech companies in Israel.\n\nIsrael also has more companies on NASDAQ than all of Europe, Korea, Japan, Singapore, China, and India combined. In addition to their closely aligned foci, Israel is a strategically smart business destination for Patrick as he looks to present our state as a model of emergence out of the recession.","dt":"2011-02-24 15:25:26 -0800"},"272":{"terms":[{"id":7,"name":"Opinion"}],"title":"All quiet on the Western front: the shortage of civic students","body":"<strong>Daniel Schneider, Beacon Contributor</strong>\n\nAmidst the united cheers following the removal of Hosni Mubarak from his seat of power in Egypt, a thought crossed my mind. The image of tens of thousands marching through the streets of Cairo has certainly been powerful, even inspiring. But to what extent can we look on these events without seeing some of our own inadequacies as citizens?\n\nWe think of ourselves as having a strong national civic tradition, yet I have yet to see as passionate and large a protest in America during my lifetime as is going on in the Middle East today — especially from my own generation.\n\nMany Americans remain in civic stagnation between the midterm elections and the next presidential race. Students at Emerson are often even less engaged, only bothering to perk up their ears every four years.\n\nWhy many students fail to engage themselves in politics and government is not very clear. The cheap answer is that we just don’t care, “we’re a school full of lackadaisical, spoiled brats” — but it’s not that simple. Nor is it as simple as a lack of understanding. We know our federal government exerts enormous influence on our lives.\n\nAnyone who has tried to film on a Boston street corner, interview a local politician, or received a ticket from the Boston Police knows that what happens at City Hall and the State House affects us, too.\n\nThis is typically the part of an op-ed on civic engagement when the writer tells you to write a letter, make a phone call, or stand naked on a street corner with a sandwich board reading ‘Don’t Tread On Me.’ But I’ll skip this part, largely because we’ve been hearing it since we were old enough to know that the executive branch didn’t have any leaves.\n\nThis list rarely inspires anyone to do what it suggests, for a reason that I’ll call the Third Law of Civic Motion: For every laundry list of “ways to get involved,” there is an equal and opposite laundry list of “reasons why I can’t.”\n\nThese reasons range from the ineffectual (“I just don’t want to”) to the paranoid (“Government is an untrustworthy, self-serving body of lies”), but a student’s most common excuse for their lack of engagement is that of time. Which is, more often than not, a valid excuse. This would seem to be the impasse which ends the discussion: Can a full-time student be expected to go beyond being a minimally informed citizen? It may require a feat of synthesis, rather than scheduling, but I believe it’s wholly possible.\n\nEven though our career aspirations may not extend very far into civic life, there is usually an overlap that provides an easy way to make volunteerism work. For journalism and political communication students at Emerson, the task is fairly straightforward.\n\nFor other majors, it may not be as easy, but the opportunities are still there. Acting and design tech majors might consider that their job will eventually require them to join a union; film majors will have to consider states that offer tax credits when they have the opportunity for larger-budget shoots.\n\nThough it is less direct than taking on another chorus role or being a key grip, supporting candidates and legislation which will benefit you in the future is not time wasted: it’s an assurance for one’s professional future (and might not look too shabby on a resumé either, if you are concerned with such things).\n\nAmerica may not have the same need to shake off a repressive dictatorship that Egypt or Tunisia has had. We have applauded the events in Egypt only to miss its clear message: an engaged populous is not merely a boon to real change, but a prerequisite.\n\nThough we may consider ourselves marketers and singers and writers first, the truth is we are citizens of the United States first, and with that title comes the responsibility to stay involved.","dt":"2011-02-24 15:27:44 -0800"},"275":{"terms":[{"id":3,"name":"Arts &amp; Entertainment"}],"title":"The Wang makes it Rain with a show of Beatles covers","body":"<strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Alicia Lazzaro, </span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Beacon Correspondent</span></strong>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_326\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"150\" caption=\"Photo Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons\"]<a href=\"http://www.berkeleybeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/wikimedia-commons.jpg\"><img class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-326\" title=\"wikimedia-commons\" src=\"http://www.berkeleybeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/wikimedia-commons-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>[/caption]\n\nJohn, Paul, George, and Ringo will be rocking the Wang Theatre this weekend. Well, sort of.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Wearing wigs and appropriate Beatle garb, Steve Landes as John, Joe Bithorn as George, Joey Curatolo as Paul, and Ralph Castelli as Ringo make up Rain — A Tribute to the Beatles. </span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">The tribute band, Rain, will be gracing the stage to perform its rendition of the Beatles’ classics. Although there will never be an actual reunion of the Liverpool quartet, seeing Rain is the next best thing.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">The group’s website explains that Rain, originally named “Reign,” began as a southern California bar band in the 1970s and was transformed by Mark Lewis, founder and manager. Lewis converted the band into a full-out Beatle bonanza. Rain tours the country as a tribute show on Broadway. Their big claim to fame came when they were hired to do the music for the 1979 movie Birth of the Beatles, produced by Dick Clark.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">The show covers music from the Beatles’ debut on the Ed Sullivan show up until their break-up in 1970. They cover over 30 hits such as “Let It Be,” “Come Together,” and “Hey Jude.”</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">This show aims not only to rekindle your love of the Beatles, but to evoke your inner hippie with a time-traveling multimedia extravaganza. Video montages displayed behind the faux Fab Four recreate historical snapshots such as TV commercials of the time to the Civil Rights Movement, according to Frank Scheck’s review in the Hollywood Reporter.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">“I liken it to the authors of Beatles books,” Landes said in an interview with CBS. “They write out their books to tell the story of the Beatles to try and explain to the world what it was like at those times.  And we do the same thing, only on stage and using their music.” </span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Videos of past performances posted on Rain’s website demonstrate the group’s passion for the Beatles’ artistry. Although there are many aspects to the show, it really is about the music. They do not use any pre-recorded tapes; every note is performed live.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">All of the band members have had a passion for playing music their entire lives, according to their website. Both Landes and Curatolo taught themselves how to play guitar when they were 10 years old. Bithorn was already belting out harmonies at age three and could play guitar by ear at age 14. Castelli started drumming at age six, and Lewis has been an accomplished pianist since age five. </span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">In addition to being technically skilled, they are known to be enthusiastic performers — according to a review by Dan Bacalzo for Theatremania.com, Rain invites the audience to belt out the lyrics along with them.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">“We feel like the audience almost has a religious experience if we do it right,” said Lewis in the interview with CBS. “[It’s] because they love the music and we love the music.”</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\"><em>The Wang Theatre will host Rain on Friday, Feb. 25 at 8 p.m. and Saturday, Feb. 26 at 3 p.m. and 8 p.m.</em></span>","dt":"2011-02-24 15:31:59 -0800"},"289":{"terms":[{"id":14,"name":"Editorial"}],"title":"Davis denotes importance of history","body":"<!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 15.0px Arial} p.p2 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 16.0px Times; min-height: 19.0px} --><strong>Editorial Staff</strong>\n\n<em>At issue:</em>\n\nRespected activist Angela Davis speaks on campus\n\n<em>Our take:</em>\n\nVisit demonstrates the lessons Emersonians can learn from the past\n\nAngela Davis is historically awesome.\n\nShe was a force in the Black Panther Party, the author of several books opposing the prison system, and was once a member of the Communist Party USA.\n\nAfter months of effort, Emerson’s Black Organization with Natural Interests (EBONI) succeeded in bringing a woman with over 60 years of diverse experiences, views, and knowledge to our campus. What better way to commemorate African American Heritage month than to hear the perspective from a veteran of the Black rights movement who continues to use her experiences from the 1960s and 70s to affect change today?\n\nOver 150 students gathered in the Semel Theater to learn about our history from the very woman who was a part of it.\n\nDavis’s presence on Emerson’s campus provides us with the chance to reflect on our own culture of change. Emerson students are known for their irreverent drive, their passion for innovation, and their idolatry of the next hot thing. But this fire for the future often comes by parting with the past. On a campus often hell-bent on moving forward, Davis is a reminder that we have much to learn from the generations before us.\n\nSo in the spirit of African American Heritage month, let’s learn. Stop editing that script that just isn’t flowing right, stop writing that paper that’s due in five hours and stop doing all that super-creative stuff for your super-creative class at your super-creative school. Put your future on pause and rewind. By understanding the story that preceded us, we’ll be better equipped for the future.\n\nTalk to your elders. We might be masters of the cool-young-hipster-social-online revolution, but that doesn’t make us infallible<em>. </em>Their knowledge beats ours by decades. Let’s recognize and appreciate yesteryear’s innovators by taking the time to hear their stories. Not just the Angela Davis’s of the world, but the professor down the hall and the grandmother back home. Just as Davis said yesterday, “The most important contributions came from people whose names we do not remember today.”\n\nThank you to EBONI for introducing Davis to our institution. Thank you to SGA for awarding the funds to make this event happen. And thank you to the students who showed up and listened to her speak.\n\nWe could all use a little bit of history before we make history.\n\n&nbsp;","dt":"2011-02-17 23:13:48 -0800"},"294":{"terms":[{"id":7,"name":"Opinion"}],"title":"Emerson students need more heart for the homeless","body":"<!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 15.0px Arial} p.p2 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 16.0px Times; min-height: 19.0px} --><strong>Taylor Gearhart, Beacon Staff</strong>\n\nEmerson Student A: God, homeless people are so gross.\n\nEmerson Student B: Ugh, yeah, why can’t they just leave us alone?\n\nChances are you’ve either participated in a similar conversation or overheard one yourself. Emerson is located smack in the middle of the city and walking past homeless people is simply part of life on campus. Sometimes they ask for money. Sometimes they catcall. And often, they make us feel uncomfortable.\n\nBut you know what is more uncomfortable than walking by some homeless guys?\n\nBeing homeless.\n\nAccording to Boston’s most recent homeless census, 7,681 men, women, and children are homeless in this city. But the truth is, most Emerson students have no idea what that really means. Our daily lives are plagued by problems that can be punctuated by some variance of  #soemerson, #whitegirlproblems, and #fml.\n\nBut even if empathy for the homeless doesn’t always come instinctively to the average Emersonian, I have to believe we can do better than make flippant comments about our homeless neighbors. There is no excuse for such insensitivity.\n\nIn our classrooms we speak with the utmost humanity and intensity regarding the struggles and hardships of people around the world. I am proud to be part of a community that values a globally conscious curriculum, but I fear we consistently fail to address the suffering that happens between the classrooms we sit in and the nearest CVS.\n\nSt. Francis House, the shelter and rehabilitation center, is less than a block from our campus and serves more than 800 poor and homeless men and women every day, according to its website. Yet in my nearly four years at Emerson, I have rarely — if ever — heard St. Francis House mentioned as more than an inconvenience.\n\nAccording the Boston homeless census, a quarter of homeless people suffer from substance abuse, another quarter have disabling conditions, and 30 percent suffer from mental illness. Still others suffer from a combination of physical disabilities, domestic violence, and HIV/AIDS. Is that really a demographic of people we should treat with impatience?\n\nI suspect our glib remarks about the homeless stem from our fear of their experience. Homelessness is sad and scary. Often it seems emotionally easier to speak in generalities about big global problems than it is to even make eye contact with the man begging for change on the corner.\n\nThe best way to combat fear is with education. Our Office of Service Learning and Community Action provides numerous programs for students who are looking to do community service — and even students who are specifically interested in working with the homeless.\n\nSadly, few among us have time to add a community service project to our schedules. We rush to and from our classrooms, discussing issues affecting Egypt, Haiti, and Sudan, pretending issues right here in Boston don’t exist. But they do exist and our failure to acknowledge the injustices literally around the corner fosters tactless behavior. It allows Emerson students to feel entitled — to be irritated and disgusted by the homeless rather than compassionate and concerned.\n\nThis attitude does not apply to all Emerson students, and those of you who have experience or insight into the realities of homelessness and poverty: Speak up. Do not let your classmates or professors belittle the people that need our support most.\n\nYou would never let your peers be derogatory about other minorities. Defend impoverished people in the same way you would ethnic groups, sexual identities, and religious beliefs — fiercely.\n\nI don’t have all the answers, or even half of them, but I cannot believe that tolerating ignorant and abusive behavior toward our homeless neighbors is an acceptable option.\n\nI urge our community to hold one another accountable, — to be more compassionate. Homeless people are, above all else, people. That fact alone is something Emersonians of all ages could do well to remember.\n\n&nbsp;","dt":"2011-02-17 23:46:37 -0800"},"295":{"terms":[{"id":7,"name":"Opinion"}],"title":"Egypt: Don’t celebrate yet","body":"<!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 16.0px Times New Roman} p.p2 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 16.0px Times; min-height: 19.0px} --><strong>Sarah Betancourt, <strong>Beacon Contributor</strong></strong>\n\nOver the past three weeks, we watched millions of Egyptians struggle against their government in a quest for democracy.\n\nOn Feb. 11, protesters celebrated as Hosni Mubarak resigned his post and handed power over to the military. The Huffington Post declared the people’s revolution in Egypt a “success.” But while there is cause for jubilation, it is ill-premised to consider that a revolt is all that is needed to birth a democracy.\n\nEgypt’s military, now the governing power, vowed a transition to democracy “as soon as possible,” according to an article in Saturday’s New York Times.\n\nThe military assured that all existing international treaties would be honored during this phase. This allows Israel and Saudi Arabia to breathe a sigh of relief.\n\nStill, the Middle East remains a precarious place as nearby countries succumb to waves of protests against autocratic governments.\n\nThe U.S. has worked to spread democracy for decades. But we have proven to be masters of masking idealism with capitalist interests. Students are right to be skeptical of the Obama Administration’s vocal support for Egypt’s transition into peaceful democracy. The United States generally favors pragmatism over idealism. We proclaim to have an allegiance to universal democracy, but our behavior follows our business interests.\n\nWe have seen this in our relationship with China and our ongoing dialogue concerning human rights. We urge China to allow its citizen’s the freedom of speech and to release dissidents like Liu Xiaobo, but in the end, economic interests prevail.\n\nAmerican officials have sat down with opposition parties of questionable Western loyalties. Their primary concern has been the Muslim Brotherhood and gauging its anti-Israeli sentiments. The Muslim Brotherhood is Egypt’s most powerful non-governmental opposition party in Egypt. It currently seeks to be a legitimate party within the future parliament but does not seek to field a presidential candidate. Even if the Brotherhood did want a shot at power, only 15 percent of Egyptians would actually vote for the Brotherhood during elections.\n\nNews outlets in America have continued to sell the improbable scenario in which the Muslim Brotherhood and religious extremists take power in Egypt. But according to Tuesday’s New York Times, a panel of jurists have been appointed to revise Egypt’s constitution, including Sobhi Saleh, a legal expert for the Brotherhood. Another member, Maher Samy Youssef, will be representing Coptic Christians.\n\nThese two appointments seem to imply Egypt’s military and intellectuals are willing to put aside their religious differences in order to pursue a freer state.\n\nThroughout the 18 day conflict, there were reports of Christians allowing Muslims into their homes to pray in safety from the surrounding chaos. Religious differences were forgotten by the universal need for bread on the table and the right to speak freely.\n\nBut media outlets sell the prospect of sectarian violence to disguise the true motive for U.S. hesitation: Its economic agenda.\n\nSo how is the United States backing expediency? The U.S. has donated $2 billion a year in military aid to Egypt since 1979, according to ProPublica, a nonprofit news organization. In return, Egypt exports 89,000 barrels of crude oil a day, while also operating and owning the Suez Canal.  Roughly 2.4 million barrels travel through the canal each day, making each of the 19.4 million barrels the U.S. consumes that much easier.\n\nDo the math. Would it be in the United States’ interest to allow conflict to erupt and gamble with the ownership of the Suez canal? There is a lot of money invested in Egypt. The market value of corporations based in Egypt is listed at over $90 billion, according to Arabian Construction Week . Money speaks volumes, and the U.S. grows more tense as our gallons of gas become more expensive.\n\nOf course, this doesn’t matter to the Egyptian poor, who take up 44 percent of the population. We support their quest for social freedom and employment. But we are wary of their anti-Israeli sentiment and the consequences recent events may have on oil imports.\n\nWe must choose to either honor their quest for democracy or continue forward in our own best interests.\n\n&nbsp;","dt":"2011-02-17 23:47:41 -0800"}}
