The nominations will be narrowed down, and a poll of 2013 class members will determine the final beneficiary.Burch said the idea rose after she and other council members brainstormed ideas to connect with their classmates.</div>\n<div>\n\n“While something great comes out of uniting a class, I think something really great would be all of us deciding where we are going to contribute this money,” the acting major said.\n\nAccording to Burch, classes typically have little to no say in what happens with their money. The funds raised during junior year are usually put towards a jam-packed senior year of events, including senior week. Elizabeth Mantey, vice president of the junior class, said she is excited to change the standard.\n\n“We wanted the class as a whole to really have a say in where the money went,” the visual, media, arts major said.\n\nAccording to Mantey, the class funds are still sufficient enough to put towards senior week. Additional money raised for the class this year will broaden the budget, allowing for extra to be given to the beneficiary.\n\nPaige Sammartino, said she thinks highly of the idea.\n\n“There are so many places our money could go and I think charity is one of the best options,” the junior writing, literature, and publishing major said.\n\nAlyssa Macaluso, however, doesn’t think a poll through Facebook is an effective way to get the attention of the student body.\n\n“Honestly, there is not enough time. You get so many [Facebook] events at one time and basically just become numb to it,” the design technology major said. “Facebook events as a whole are like an invitation to a bachelor party.”\n\nDespite Malcuso’s idea of the event, students have already made submissions. Suggestions for a beneficiary have included class of 2013-specific funds and students as well as local Boston charities. Submissions for beneficiaries end on Sept. 24, and a poll for the final choices will run from Sept. 26 to Oct. 2.\n\nMantey said she hopes other class councils latch on to the idea and start putting their funds to causes outside Emerson.\n\n“It would be really awesome if people jumped on the bandwagon and did that,” she said.\n\n</div>","dt":"2011-09-22 14:22:33 -0400"},"849":{"terms":[{"id":6,"name":"News"}],"title":"Oldest theatre in Boston shuts down temporarily","body":"<div><strong><strong>Jeannie Rodriguez, Beacon Staff</strong></strong></div>\n<div>Boston’s oldest continuously operating theater closed its doors this summer with no projection of when it will open again. The Colonial Theatre went dark in July after negotiations failed between Emerson College, owner of the theater, and Broadway Across</div>\n<div>America-Boston, the organization that has leased the theater over the last decade.Andrew Tiedemann, vice president of communications and marketing at Emerson College, said the closure of the theater resulted from bad timing and lack of communication between the two parties.</div>\n<div>Anticipating that its Colonial lease would end on August 31, 2011, Broadway Across America-Boston approached Emerson in January 2010 to sign a new deal. Tiedemann said the college told its longtime tenants that it first wanted to explore other potential producers to lease the theater before signing a contract.</div>\n<div>\n\nThat led Broadway Across America-Boston to seek other options, too. When Emerson came back to them to renegotiate the original deal, it was too late.\n\n“Of course, nobody wants to see [the Colonial] go dark,” said Rich Jaffe, Broadway Across America- Boston vice president, to the Boston Globe. “But you get to the point where you have to find a venue for your productions.”\n\nAccording to their website, Broadway Across America-Boston will present two musicals next season at the Shubert Theatre, part of the Citi Performing Arts Center. The remainder of the theatre company’s nine-production season will be presented at the Boston Opera House.\n\nEmerson is using the period of time the Colonial is closed to upgrade the sprinkler system, with renovations taking place in August and September. Tiedemann said Emerson would have had to close the theater to make these changes regardless of the scheduling conflict.\n\n“This is Emerson College; we’re theater people,” Tiedemann said. “We can’t see the future, but hopefully this isn’t for long.”\n\nHe said the college is continuing to negotiate with prospective tenants but declined to give the names of any potential leasers.\n\nLuke Jones, a graduate student and graphic designer for ArtsEmerson, said he is not too concerned about the Colonial closing.\n\n“I've heard it through the Emerson grapevine that Broadway Across America will most likely eventually renegotiate for it and it will probably reopen in a year or two,” Jones said.\n\nTheater education student Chris Sawey said he is saddened by the theater’s closing and hopes Emerson fills the vacancy soon.\n\n“Who could possibly be better than Broadway Across America?” Sawey said. “The great thing about the Colonial Theatre was that it brought people from all over the city, but who knows, maybe this is part of Emerson’s master plan of some sort. It’s just a matter of time before they see it take a toll on the community.”\n\n</div>","dt":"2011-09-08 17:28:04 -0400"},"680":{"terms":[{"id":10,"name":"Student of the Week"}],"title":"Student of the Week: David Levine","body":"<div>If asked to describe my roommate David “Daddy D” Levine in three words, I would go with tall, Jewish, and film-major. But that hardly begins to describe him. David is like a Russian doll with all of his different talents and passions stored up inside of him.&nbsp;\n\nAt the very least, he’s a triple threat: a student, a filmmaker, and a man.  As a film production major and a marketing minor, he excels in his classes to the point of classmates often mistaking him for a teacher’s assistant.  He puts that same intensity and brilliance into everything he does. He has worked on countless film shoots, he currently writes for The Common Agenda, and he’s an incredible ping-pong player. (Fun Fact: Levine is undefeated in ping-pong at the Boston University Hillel House.) Also, he co-created a condiment hybrid made up of honey mustard and barbeque sauce. It’s called Sauce-some or Awesome Sauce, and it’s incredible.\n\nBest of all, Levine doesn’t let his success get to him. He is one of the kindest, most down-to-earth people I have ever known.  I challenge you to picture the biggest thing you can possibly think of. Guess what? Levine’s heart is bigger than that.\n\nI wish I could tell you all about Levine’s success as a student and a person, but I’m writing a mini-profile, not a Russian novel.  Instead I will end with this: If there were more people like David Levine, the world could start again.\n\n</div>\n<div>-Brendan O’Brien</div>","dt":"2011-04-21 04:50:55 -0400"},"152":{"terms":[],"title":"Ad Rates","body":"<span style=\"color: #000000;\"> </span>\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\">The <em>Berkeley Beacon</em> is distributed for free every Thursday during the academic year, the 12-page newspaper covers college and local news, opinion and editorial content, Emerson athletics, lifestyle, and both Emerson and local arts. 2,500 copies are distributed to the Emerson community every week.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\"><strong>Demographics</strong></div>\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\">Emerson College’s current enrollment is 3,600 undergraduate students and 900</div>\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\">graduate students, with more than 400 faculty.</div>\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\">As the only institution in the country dedicated to communications and the arts, the</div>\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\">student body at Emerson is one of a kind.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\"><strong>Rate Card</strong></div>\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\"><em>Color:</em></div>\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\">Half page: $525</div>\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\">Quarter: $275</div>\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\">Eighth: $140</div>\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\"><em>Black and White:</em></div>\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\">Half page: $450</div>\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\">Quarter: $225</div>\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\">Eighth: $110</div>\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\">Volume buys may be discounted.

The five-page ethics paper due in five hours wasn’t going to write itself.\n\nHe couldn’t focus. Time was running out. He needed a quick fix.\n\n“I saw a friend of mine and he was like, ‘Oh, would you wanna try it?’” Brian, a visual and media arts major, recalled. “I figured, why not?”\n\n“It” was Concerta, Brian said, a spinoff of the prescription drug Ritalin and similar to Adderall. Each is prescribed to adolescents to help combat Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, according to the ADHD organization’s website, and can help improve the focus and ability to work of those who take it.\n\nStudents interviewed for this report said abuse of Adderall and Ritalin is common at Emerson and enables its users to get a high that increases their attentiveness and endurance.\n\nJane Powers, the director of Emerson’s center for health and wellness, provided the <em>Beacon </em>with statistics of Adderall and Ritalin abuse among the student body from a survey conducted last May.\n\n“At Emerson the reported use was 14% of the male and 11% of the female respondents had used either of these medications (Adderall and Ritalin) without prescription,” Powers said in an e-mail, adding that 579 students responded to the survey, about 20 percent of the entire student body.\n\nThis rate is higher than the national average, Powers said in her e-mail. Based on results from the American College Health Association’s National College Health Assessment survey, the nationwide response average was eight percent of male and six percent of female college students reported illegally using the drugs.\n\nPowers cautioned against the serious side affects of abusing these drugs and said the health center warns students who have prescriptions for these drugs to keep them in a locked, safe place and to not share them.\n\nThe problem seems to transcend Emerson. One out of every five college students in America have abused the drug, according to estimates by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Just yesterday, five Columbia University students were arrested for dealing drugs out of their fraternity house on campus, according to CBS news. Among the drugs seized by police was Adderall.\n\nDr. John Sargent, the chief of child psychiatry at Tufts Medical Center, said while the drug is akin to other illegal substances and has harmful side effects, it does provide what students want: extra energy.\n\n“It’s a stimulant,” Sargent said. “It is in the same class of drugs as methamphetamine, which is speed, and it is just as addictive. But there’s no question that it focuses concentration, somebody might abuse it to get high and some might use it to stay up at night.”\n\nFor Brian, the jolt was nearly instantaneous. Two hours after taking the pill and slumping into the lumpy, red couch in the sixth floor common room, his paper was finished.\n\n“It had an extreme effect,” the sophomore said. “I became really happy, I was writing and getting things done. In a video game sense, it’s a power up.” I love this analogy me too, great quote\n\nThe most common way for students without ADHD to get the drug is for those who have a prescription to sell the leftovers.\n\nAn Emerson sophomore and self-described Adderall dealer said she sells about 20 pills out of the 30 she receives each month from her prescription.\n\nThe marketing major said she regularly deals 20 milligram extended release capsules to about seven students, but that there are other pill peddlers on campus who sell to 20, or even 30 people.\n\n“I dealt a little bit in high school with friends,” the marketing major said. “Then I got to college, and it was like a boom here.”\n\nMost pills sell for around $5 to $10 a piece, the dealer said. Some suppliers sell larger, 64-milligram pills, which can command a higher price.\n\nMany students who consume the drug, she said, simply swallow it. But some crush and snort it for a more immediate, intense effect.\n\nSargent said snorting the drug will make it enter the bloodstream quicker, but cautioned against the side effects of the drug, which can include increased heart rate, long-term damage to one’s body, and decreased sleep and appetite. One report from the online ADHD help center said it can, in rare cases, result in sudden death syndrome.\n\n“It’s pretty clear that it’s commonly abused,” Sargent said. “I think it’s a problem because the person who’s diverting it [the dealer] is causing problems.”\n\nOver four million children are prescribed Adderall each year in the United States, a CBS News report said. The drug stimulates chemical in the brain that control attentiveness, which help ADHD patients focus, Sargent said.\n\nBut when abused on college campuses, it’s an easy way to cram.\n\n“It’s a pretty common method,” the dealer said. “I don’t think people want to be taking drugs, but there’s such pressure coming from everyone. Mediocrity isn’t that accepted anymore. You have to stand out.”\n\nPowers had a similar take, saying she is not surprised by the prescription drug abuse on campus.\n\n“Emerson is an extremely competitive environment and there is a great deal of anxiety and stress concerning academic performance,” Powers said. “Some students may feel the \"need\" to use these medications in order to do well and because these are \"legal prescription drugs\" they may be perceived to be \"safe\" to use.”\n\nThat was the motivation for one sophomore digital post production major who popped two 64-milligram Adderalls 12 hours apart. The tiny blue pills kept her awake for 40 hours.\n\n“I was a little jittery,” she said. “People asked me if I was sick. I guess I looked strung out, but I wasn’t. I felt great.”\n\nSargent said the effects of becoming addictive could shorten one’s lifespan.\n\n“It’s what could happen to ‘speedfreaks’ who are using a lot of methamphetamine,” Sargent said. “They just age faster. You’re burning up calories with no fuel. It’s a big problem.”\n\nBottom line, one sophomore theater studies major said, Adderall provides many college students with what they want: a quick and easy shot of adrenaline.\n\n“Part of me feels like it’s a modern-day, enhanced version of speed,” he said. “Just less dangerous.”","dt":"2010-12-09 04:45:34 -0500"},"130":{"terms":[{"id":20,"name":"Berkeley Beacon"},{"id":24,"name":"cage"},{"id":25,"name":"cage free eggs"},{"id":32,"name":"chickens"},{"id":38,"name":"David Colman-Hidy"},{"id":41,"name":"eggs"},{"id":45,"name":"Emerson College"},{"id":70,"name":"Morgan St. John"},{"id":104,"name":"writing"},{"id":6,"name":"News"}],"title":"1,400 call for cage-free","body":"<strong>Heidi Moeller, Beacon Staff</strong><em>\n</em>\n\nWhen alumnus David Colman-Hidy started asking students to petition for cage-free eggs in Emerson’s dining halls last October, he expected that, with enough support, the college would ban battery cage eggs by the start of the spring semester.\n\nMore than three months and 1,400 student signatures later, cafeteria cooks still default to battery cage eggs from factory farms that cramp hens into cages smaller than a sheet of letter-sized paper.\n\nOne day before Colman-Hidy was scheduled to meet with Aramark and submit the petition, he said the college deferred his appeal to boot battery cage eggs by offering cage-free eggs on request. Aramark then canceled the meeting, he said.\n\n“What’s become so grievous is not the cage-free issue, it’s now more of an unresponsive administration,” said Colman-Hidy, who graduated with a degree in political communication last year. “It’s the fact that they are not responding to the overwhelming support and willingness of cost from students.”\n\nBattery cage farms confine chickens to overcrowded cages that prevent them from nesting or spreading their wings, according to the Humane Society website. Factory farms that produce cage-free eggs raise the birds on open floor space.\n\nAndrew Tiedemann, vice president of public affairs, said the college cannot negotiate terms with Aramark to stock exclusively cage-free eggs until their current contract expires in June. But he said 240 of the 1,800 eggs served to students between November and December were cage-free.\n\nHowever, dismayed by the college’s heedless response, Chris Girard, a fellow 2010 alum, started a Facebook event last month titled “TELL EMERSON COLLEGE: respect student opinion and prevent animal cruelty!” The event had 69 members as of Wednesday night.\n\nGirard, a former editor at the Beacon, said he spurred more than 100 alums to write, e-mail, and call institutional advancement, which oversees alumni donations, stating they will not donate money to the school until the dining hall is completely rid of battery cage eggs.\n\n“It’s very important that the Emerson administration listen to students’ concerns,” Girard said. “I’m puzzled and disheartened that they haven’t taken a strong step.”\n\nTiedemann said he responded to each person who contacted institutional advancement, telling them the college has offered cage-free eggs upon request, and the administration is calculating the increase.\n\n“There are contractual and financial considerations,” Tiedemann said in an interview. “We can not switch until the new academic year because of our contract, and we also have to figure out how much of an increase it would be to the meal plan.”\nColman-Hidy, who is the Boston Campaign Coordinator at The Humane League, has also worked with Bay State College to help them go cage-free.\n\n“It’s kind of a no-brainer issue to me,” Colman-Hidy said. “It is criminal animal cruelty in seven states and anywhere in Europe. [Aramark] is missing the point.”\n\nChris Guinn, a senior journalism major, works for Aramark. He contributed to creating the petition and gathering student signatures. Although he has no longer been collecting student signatures, he said the support from the student body is still present.\n\n“Students still keep asking when cage-free eggs will be in the dining hall,” Guinn said. “These students signed the petition because they wanted their voices to be heard. They are still passionate even though we are dealing with [the administration].”\nThe Student Government Association gave their full support for the cage-free egg initiative in a statement late last November.\n“The Emerson College SGA expects this initiative to be honored in full no later than the beginning of March 2011, and to communicate with the student body regarding its progress toward those ends,” the statement read.\n\nSGA Vice President Tau Zaman said he fully supports the alums’ initiatives.\n\n“I think it’s great that we have alumni who care about the school enough to change things that don’t affect them anymore,” Zaman said. “I hope that undergraduates can find their own level of dissatisfaction and work towards justice.”\n\nZaman also said the fact that Emerson is bound to a contract with its food provider should not be the reason Emerson doesn’t change to cage-free eggs.\n\n“Our contract can say any number of things, and the student body probably wasn’t involved in creating that contract,” Zaman said. “It’s [the college’s] responsibility to address it.”","dt":"2011-01-20 19:51:39 -0500"},"281":{"terms":[{"id":14,"name":"Editorial"}],"title":"Don’t be a chicken Emerson, go cage free.","body":"<h1><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Editorial Staff</span></h1>\nSome of us felt pretty cooped up over break. There isn’t that much to do, your parents want to spend every waking moment watching home videos, and your siblings have taken the family car. Now imagine your family of five living in a box just under nine by nine by nine feet—not just for break, but for your whole life. Those are the dimensions your home would be if you were one of the battery cage hens producing the eggs that make omelets and breakfast sandwiches in Emerson’s dining hall.\n\nNot happy with that information? You are not alone.\n\nOver a third of Emerson’s graduate and undergraduate student body—1,400 students—have signed a petition calling for cage-free eggs in the college’s cafeteria.\n\nUnfortunately this staggering percentage has not inspired much urgency.\n\nAccording to Vice President of Public Affairs Andrew Tiedemann, a negotiation with the school’s food provider Aramark cannot take place until their contract is up for review in June. Until then, students can request cage-free eggs, but the default will not change.\n\nThat’s cracked. And it sounds more like bologna than eggs. The college, as an employer, probably has more leverage than it cares to admit. Other colleges Aramark serves, including Vassar College and the University of Minnesota, no longer purchase battery cage eggs. Should it continue its inaction, little will change in our kitchens this semester. Meanwhile, our college will continue contributing to needless animal suffering.\n\nThe ethics of battery cage eggs is hardly worth discussing. It’s a hideously cruel practice and furthermore a disgusting way to produce something intended for consumption. The whole European Union figured that out back in 2009 and has since banned the practice.\n\nBut perhaps more importantly, this series of events leads us to question whether Emerson takes the concerns of its student body seriously. If contractual barriers are as impenetrable as the college claims, we should at least receive a promise that, come June, changes will be made.\n\nThe good news is we can take a stand now, without the support of the college, much like David Coman-Hidy and Chris Guinn did last semester when they launched their campaign for cage-free eggs. We’re consumers too, after all.\n\nIf you don’t want to support battery cage eggs, don’t.  Ask for cage free eggs when you’re having your breakfast made or opt out of eggs all together. Then tell your friends to do the same. Last semester 240 of the 1,800 eggs served to students between November and December were cage-free.

There was no reason for the players to even suspect such an announcement. After the meeting, the athletic department posted on its website that the coach of 16 years had “decided to leave the College to pursue other interests.”\n\nBut the players in the locker room that day tell a different story. Junior Carlos Negrete said Nance explained to the team that, “People higher up in the school are looking to go in a different direction.”\n\nLater, William P. Gilligan, the vice president of information technology who oversees athletics for President Jacqueline Liebergott, told a Beacon reporter that the decision to “no longer have” Mr. Smith as the coach was made by the College.\n\nSo far, neither administrators in the athletics department nor those in President Liebergott’s office have provided any explanation for the coach’s sudden removal.  Nor have they explained why the language on the Emerson site conflicts with the story they tell in person.\n\nWhat we do know is that both players and alumni of the Emerson men’s basketball team are flabbergasted. Coach Smith, by all accounts that the Beacon can gather, was a beloved — even iconic — member of the Emerson community and a tremendous coach.\n\nAlumni from across the country have contacted the Beacon to express their outrage. Each describes a heartwarming mentor and friend. In a school renowned for revolving doors of adjunct professors, shifting academic advisors and transient housing placements, Smith was one of the few stable figures available to students. This, in addition to 258 career victories and a spot in the Great Northeast Athletic Conference finals 10 out of 16 years, leads us to believe that Smith was — at very least — very good at his job.\n\nWith so many testimonials in support of Smith and so few answers from the College, we at the Beacon have been forced by the College’s silence to question its decision to remove him.\n\nAnd amid all of the controversy only one thing is clear to us at the Beacon: The method in which the College handled this situation is deplorable. To deny students — especially the players of the men’s basketball team — an earnest explanation of its decision is disrespectful.\n\nSmith’s departure is in and of itself traumatic. The men’s basketball team is two thirds of the way through a tough season and is facing the pressure of the oncoming playoff season. Cutting their coach at this date cuts them off at their knees.\n\nBy excusing itself from any justification of their actions, the College has added insult to injury. To state that Smith “decided to leave the College to pursue other interests” only to reveal that the decision was made by administrators is disingenuous and disappointing.\n\nIf Emerson has any confidence in its decision, it should be up-front and direct about the choice it made. The members of this community are entitled to an honest dialogue.\n\nUntil then, we students should show we care.\n\nLet’s rally behind our basketball team. Show up to their next game, this  Saturday at 3 p.m. Not very many of us play sports at the collegiate level, so perhaps we cannot fully understand the pain and confusion that our players are experiencing. Still, all of us have at one time or another had a life-changing mentor — surely we can empathize on that level.\n\nAnd to the members of the men’s basketball team: Do not be afraid to demand answers. Your confusion is not yours alone. Your teammates, fellow Lions, former basketball players spanning nearly 20 years, and this editorial board are here to support you.\n\n</div>\n&nbsp;","dt":"2011-01-27 23:03:01 -0500"},"292":{"terms":[{"id":7,"name":"Opinion"}],"title":"Obama’s Supporters need to revive their vigor","body":"<h1><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-size: 13px;\"><strong>John Keane, Beacon Staff</strong></span></h1>\n“At 11 p.m., the wild rumpus began on Boylston Street as Emerson residence halls spewed forth throngs of students who marched down the street toward Copley Square.”\nEmily Carroll wrote those words in the Beacon on Nov. 6, 2008, two days after President Obama’s election. People were electrified. Students  — those apathetic Americans whom pundits believed to be more sluggish than civic  — voted in hordes. A few weeks later, Obama announced in his inaugural address that he would usher in “a new era of responsibility.” It felt as though we were witnessing history in real time. And we were. Walking down Boylston street  — I kid you not  — a Boston local actually wished me a good afternoon.\n\nLast Friday marked the anniversary of Obama’s inauguration, the halfway mark in his historic term. Despite all his accomplishments, one can’t help but notice: For many of those who went crazy back in 2008, the wind has left our sails.\n\nAccording to a recent Gallup poll, 49 percent of Americans approve of the job he is doing. President Obama’s first two years boasted the biggest budget deficits, measured as a share of national GDP, since World War II. According to the New York Times, unemployment remains around 10 percent, 16 percent for individuals between the ages of 15 and 24. Our transportation infrastructure is in desperate need of repair, and the Programme for International Student Assessment recently rated our education system at 18th in the world, between Iceland and Lichtenstein. Guantanamo is still open. And we’re still at war. Considering the challenges we still face, it’s not surprising Americans are dissatisfied with their President.\n\nBut it is disappointing. According to Bloomberg, Obama’s administration presided over the most productive Congress since the 1960’s. It passed both health care reform that is expected to cover 32 million uninsured Americans and a nuclear arms reduction treaty with Russia that the State Department says will reduce the number of warheads deployed by each country from 6,000 to 3,050. It regulated credit card companies such that they can no longer bill you for overcharging your credit card. The list goes on. Are Americans unaware of these achievements, or simply uninterested?\n\nObama’s midterm ‘shellacking’ may be evidence for the latter. The day after last November’s election, the President offered what I think is still the most compelling diagnosis of what has ailed his administration thus far. “One of the reasons I think people were excited during the campaign was the prospect of changing how business is done in Washington,” Obama said from the White House Press Room. “We were in such a hurry to get things done, we didn’t change how things got done.”\n\nThough I share the disappointment felt by some of those who voted for Obama in 2008, I think their disillusionment is a sign of fatigue, and that their blame is misplaced.\nWe should not fault Obama for failing to bring fundamental change to way Washington works. We should fault Washington.\n\nOur political class knew as well as we did the postpartisan era we envisioned on Nov. 4, 2008. Even though that dream was conceived en masse, we stupidly thought it could be achieved by one person. This task should have been entrusted to every elected official or, better still, every citizen. My disappointment is not with Obama. I’m disappointed with us.  We expected our President, after doing all in his power to pull a nation back from the brink of economic collapse, to also achieve what is uniquely in our power  — to bring fundamental change to politics.\n\nIn 2008, Obama helped us articulate a dream. Two years in, he has already proven himself an accomplished President. But to solve the problems we face, he will need more support than we have given him during the first half of his term. The changes you wish to see will not transpire without you. If, over the past two years, your dreams have turned to dust  — vacuum.\n\n&nbsp;","dt":"2011-01-27 23:32:51 -0500"},"312":{"terms":[{"id":6,"name":"News"},{"id":8,"name":"SGA Briefs"}],"title":"SGA grants publisher’s appeal","body":"<!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 15.0px Arial} p.p2 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 16.0px Times; min-height: 19.0px} --><strong>Heidi Moeller, Beacon Staff</strong>\n\nThe Undergraduate Students for Publishing appealed for $825.74 at the Student Government Association joint session meeting Tuesday, but because of ambiguous wording in the appeals packet, they will not receive any money until they have completed fundraising.\n\nBrittany Perro, class of 2011 president, questioned whether SGA could allocate the full amount because the organization has yet to raise funds. The SGA requires groups to independently raise 10 percent of their budgets before appealing to the joint session. However, Vice Treasurer Corey Starbuck said this has not yet been made clear in the appeal packets, and he did not have time to review it with the Undergraduate Students for Publishing before the appeal.\n\nVice President Tau Zaman said he blamed the SGA for the unclear wording in the appeal packet’s fundraising clause and supported granting the money.\n\n“I think we should still pass because this whole time we led them to believe that they were going to have a successful appeal,” the sophomore political communications major said. “This is something that SGA should handle on their own time, and not make another organization suffer for it.”\n\nEthan Silverstein, class of 2012 senator, highlighted that <em>em Magazine</em> appealled last semester where the SGA allocated $10,000 to the magazine when it had not raised any money.\n\n“It was brought up that the fundraising was questionable because it hasn’t happened yet. In the <em>em Mag</em> appeal there was questionable fundraising, and we allocated twice this amount for them to fix typos,” Silverstein said.\n\nMarisa LaFleur, president of the publishing group, said they plan on fundraising $100 through a series of “genre day” events in the coming months. At these events, the club will choose a popular book genre to promote and charge students a small fee to attend. For example, she said, they plan to host a romance themed event in February.\n\nStarbuck, who is taking over the duties of treasurer until a replacement is nominated, suggested that the funds be held until the undergraduate students for publishing raise the $100. Zaman made a motion on Starbuck’s recommendation and all SGA members voted yes to allocating $825.74 once they present their fundraising efforts.","dt":"2011-01-27 00:48:44 -0500"},"313":{"terms":[{"id":6,"name":"News"}],"title":"Juniors now required to dorm","body":"<!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 15.0px Arial} p.p2 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 16.0px Times; min-height: 19.0px} --><strong>Rebecca Isenhart, Beacon Correspondent</strong>\n\nLandlords in Central Square and Allston may notice a little dip in their pool of prospective tenants.  Amanda Turnley, housing operations coordinator, announced that on campus housing will now be a requirement for rising juniors at an information session on Tuesday.\n\nRising juniors can apply to be removed from on-campus housing through the reverse housing application. Turnley said a lottery system will be used to determine which applicants can move off-campus. The number of accepted reverse housing applications depends on the number of combined incoming freshmen, rising sophomores, and wait-listed students not covered by residency requirement.\n\nAccording to Turnly, rising juniors can now submit paper-only forms, available in the Office of Housing and Residence Life, due by Feb. 11.\n\nTurnley said students seeking to move off campus for medical or financial reasons, or because they are 21 or over do not have to apply for reverse housing. Instead, those students should contact OHRL.\n\nMatt Noel, sophomore performing arts major, is among those hoping to move off-campus next semester. If his reverse housing application is approved, Noel said he looks forward to an apartment in Back Bay or Central where he can be more independent from the Emerson campus.\n\n“I feel like I’ve been on campus long enough,” he said.\n\nTurnley also announced the housing selection process will now be taking place through ECMobile. All current freshmen and sophomores are required to apply for housing. Those who do not submit a housing contract will not receive a lottery number, but will instead be assigned to a room after the housing selection process is complete.\n\nWhen applying, students have the option to designate interest in a learning community, gender-neutral housing, or request specific roommates or suitemates. Students who are uninterested in any of those options and want to participate in open-room selection still have to fill out the online form, because the necessary housing contract is attached.\n\nTurnley said she is confident the switch to online applications will make the process smoother and more convenient. The Northeastern University and Boston University housing selections are done online.\n\n“There’s a lot of research out there that this system does work,” said Turnley. “Hopefully it will do well here.”\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;","dt":"2011-01-27 00:49:42 -0500"},"314":{"terms":[{"id":6,"name":"News"}],"title":"SGA to liaison student complaints with business services","body":"<!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 15.0px Arial} p.p2 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 16.0px Times; min-height: 19.0px} --><strong>Heidi Moeller, Beacon Staff</strong>\n\nOn a given night in the dining hall, Lindsey Train, a vegetarian, might go to the grill and order a veggie burger. Her burger, she said, is typically cooked right next to a regular hamburger patty, and she watches the juices from the hamburger soak into her meat-free patty. After seeing that, Train doesn’t even want to eat.\n\n“I have tried to get in touch with dining services before, but never heard anything back,” the freshman journalism major, said.\n\nTrain is not alone in her complaint. Cami Bravo, Student Government Association president, said she and other SGA members have received numerous complaints about issues surrounding business services, particularly Aramark, Emerson’s food provider.\n\n“The main concerns are the fact that they don’t label their food. Students have had instances where they ask the workers what’s in their food and the workers don’t even know. It’s just worrisome for people who have allergies, people who have a dietary restriction like vegetarians, vegans, etc,” Bravo said.\n\nAnother problem has been the grill and the legrain and legume sections of the dining hall, Bravo said. At the grill, students have witnessed workers using the same spatula to flip a grilled cheese sandwich as a raw hamburger, which not only is a concern to vegans and vegetarians, but a health issue. Bravo said vegans have also been distraught by the fact that the legrain and legume section of the dining hall is not open on the weekends, leaving them with just the salad bar.\n\nAccording to Bravo, the Student Government Association said it plans to work closely with the business services office this semester to address various complaints they have heard from students. By creating a Facebook page devoted to the issues surrounding business services such as the food served by Aramark, the bookstore, laundry centers, print and copy center, and the convenience store, SGA president Cami Bravo said she hopes to allow more student voices to be heard.\n\n“We want to make sure that it’s not just SGA concerns. A lot of the stuff we’ve heard about are from friends or from people who aren’t on SGA, so that’s why we created the business services facebook page,” the junior marketing major said. “But right now, our biggest issue is getting the word out about this page and making sure students are using it.”\n\nRepresentatives from the business services office spoke with members of SGA last semester to answer questions they had, primarily regarding food in the dining hall. This was the first time anyone from business services had been invited to attend an SGA joint session meeting. Andrew Mahoney, director of business services, said while his office has tried to reach out to SGA in the past, it was never a successful relationship.\n\n“They provide an awful lot of insight and energy,” Mahoney said. “It’s easier for us to give people what they want if we know what they want. We come to work here trying to do the best we can, we don’t come here to try and aggravate people.”\n\nThe business services office oversees all of Emerson’s dining services and administers its contract. According to Mahoney, they mostly rely on comment cards and e-mail to receive feedback from students. As mentioned by Bravo, students would like to see food labels at all stations in the dining hall. Mahoney said they are currently working on this issue.\n\n“I would say within the month there should be some additional improvement to signage,” Mahoney said. “We are aware of this and we are trying to move expeditiously on this. It’s an important request and we intend to honor it.”\n\nThe SGA is currently looking for a student to assist  representing the business services office. The representative would attend the meetings held every Wednesday at 11 a.m. in the conference room on the fourth floor of Walker building. They would also work as a liaison between the student body and the administration. Currently, Ashley Brow, communications disorders senator, is a representative, but due to problems with her availability the SGA is looking for a second student to help.\n\n“We are really excited about the prospect of dealing with a representative from SGA that speaks to the student body to get a better sense of what the students are looking for and requiring from us,” Mahoney said.\n\n&nbsp;","dt":"2011-01-27 00:50:58 -0500"},"315":{"terms":[{"id":6,"name":"News"}],"title":"Class of 2012 pres resigns, SGA approves","body":"<!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 15.0px Arial} p.p2 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 16.0px Times; min-height: 19.0px} --><strong>Heidi Moeller, Beacon staff</strong>\n\nMichael Callahan, class of 2012 president, has officially resigned from the position and is currently seeking a replacement.\n\nCallahan, who made Student Government Association members aware of his resignation last semester, has left the position because his class schedule coincides with SGA joint session meetings, which all members are required to attend.\n\nIn a statement to the SGA, Callahan said until a replacement is found, he and class of 2012 vice president Amy Davidson will be ensuring that class council meetings are still held and active.

He said the hardware negates the need for  a crew of six to 12.\n\n“The current system has far greater technology than that of our previous system,” MacArthur said. “Before, the shows never got to the same level as they do now, because each day we’d have to train a new group of people on all of the technical positions.”\n\nKyed said there are still several more phases involved in getting the control and news room up to date.\n\n“We still need to put in a new server for the editing system, as well as new interfaces,” he said. “The entire process of upgrades will take two to three years to complete.”\n\nMacArthur said students and faculty are already noticing an improvement in the quality of shows, as they are now able to do much more than they previously could.\n\n“Our crowning achievement with the system came with WEBN’s live election coverage,” said MacArthur. “[The show] went far more smoothly than ever before, which is a large testament to not only the students but also the new technology.”\n\nAccording to junior Stephanie Greenland, who works as director of WEBN and the journalism channel, the new system has far fewer limitations, providing them with the technology to create a much more sophisticated production, such as allowing them to show back to back graphics, like those CNN premiered during 2010’s mid-term elections.\n\n“This new system is definitely worth it,” the broadcast journalism major said. “This is the kind of system we’ll be coming into contact with after graduation.”\n\nAccording to MacArthur, there are no foreseeable rebuilds for at least another seven to 10 years. However, with the ever-developing industry, staying on top of technology is somewhat of a necessity.\n\n“As soon as you install anything, its out of date within a year. That’s the challenge in not only a broadcast industry but an educational institution as well.”\n\n&nbsp;","dt":"2011-01-27 00:53:47 -0500"},"318":{"terms":[{"id":6,"name":"News"}],"title":"Despite minority increase, diversity still a concern","body":"<!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 15.0px Arial} p.p2 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 16.0px Times; min-height: 19.0px} --><strong>Caitlin Collins, Beacon Staff</strong>\n\nGwendolyn Bates, the associate vice president of diversity and inclusion, said diversity is still a problem at Emerson College, despite a recent a spike in  minority students.\n\nSpeaking at a Martin Luther King, Jr. luncheon last Thursday, Bates said the number of minority students at the college is a poor reflection of diversity in the academic world.\n\n“We have to prepare students to be in a world that’s going to have a large percentage of diverse people,” she said in an interview.\n\nTikesha Morgan, director of multicultural student affairs, said the luncheon celebrated the civil rights leader’s birthday and drew attention to the college’s continued effort to diversify its students and faculty.\n\nMorgan said the population of minority students has increased significantly in recent years.

Otherwise, save swimming for the summer child.\n<strong>3. </strong>Yes, those are the Knicks. Danilo Gallinari checking himself out in the Piano Row windows? Ronny Turiaf sauntering down Boylston? Don’t freak out if you see a bunch of giants in basketball jerseys pass you on the street: they’re just the NBA champs who practice in our “secret” Bobbi Brown and Steven Plofker Gym located on the lower level of Piano Row.\n<strong>4. </strong>Trick or Treats are for Hungry College Kids. If you thought you were too old for trick-or-treating, think again — the houses on Beacon Hill give out king-size candy bars. Just make it to next semester and you can pitch that Energy Bill you wrote up in your spare time to John Kerry personally! Or avoid a foot-in-mouth moment by chewing it over with a king-size Twix.\n<strong>5.</strong> Beware of Windy Corner. Do yourself a favor and bundle up extra warm if you’re planning on voyaging to Ansin. Also, if you have a need to head south from that corner, you can stay out of the wind by cutting through the Little Building from the Tremont exit, placing you next to the Cutler Majestic.\n<strong>6.</strong> New York Pizza is open late. At least later than most Boston food joints. NYP is open until 2 a.m. on weekends and 1 a.m. on weeknights, but after 11 p.m. their by-the-slice options are limited to only cheese or pepperoni. This late-night heaven is located right past 216 Tremont.\n<strong>7.</strong> We don’t have math classes but we have Mike Brown. Professor Brown is quite possibly the most famous of Emerson professors when it comes to the scary factor. He is tough. He requires work. But every student who has taken a “Mike Brown Class” sings his praises until graduation day and beyond. Make it a point to take a class with him even if it costs you an elective. Don’t let him <em>see</em> you cry…\n<strong>8.</strong> ECCash is now accepted at the nearest CVS, Boloco, Sandella’s Flatbread Cafe, Crazy Dough’s Pizza, Lambert’s Market, and Sal’s Pizza.\n<strong>9. </strong>There are pianos in Piano Row. Not only is it  the building located next to a piano store, but on the lower level of this residence hall, there are a number of student offices (among them the <em>Beacon</em>’s) and soundproof rehearsal spaces, some of which feature pianos. Finally, you can practice that annoying, er, traditional bagpipe you’ve been driving your roommate bonkers with.\n<strong>10.</strong> The ProArts Consortium is cool. Chances are you’ve heard about the “Will and Grace” set located in our Iwasaki Library, and at some point during the semester, you may curse that set for taking up valuable space which could have contained the book you needed. Worry not! Emerson is part of the ProArts Consortium — which you should check out not only if you’re interested in taking classes at MassART or Berkeley College of Music, but also because it gives us access to Suffolk University’s library just up Tremont. Grab a book from there and then savor that lovely space we revere.\n\n&nbsp;","dt":"2011-01-20 02:07:49 -0500"},"331":{"terms":[{"id":5,"name":"Lifestyle"}],"title":"SCRUMPTIOUS COFFEE CAKE  ","body":"<h1><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-size: 13px;\"><strong>Jamie Bogert, Beacon Staff</strong></span></h1>\n<div>\n\nOne 9-inch square coffee cake.\nAll ingredients at room temperature.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees\nGrease a 9 in. square baking pan\n\n<em>Whisk together thoroughly:</em>\n\n1 ½ cups all-purpose flour\n1 cup sugar\n2 teaspoons baking power\n½ teaspoon baking soda\n¼ teaspoon salt\n\n<em>In a large bowl, beat well the following:</em>\n\n1 cup sour cream (Sounds crazy, but we’re serious!

Though their selection of hot beverages isn’t as elaborate as that of your favorite chain coffee company, their one-of-a-kind food, desserts, and atmosphere will make your yummy-sensors tingle.\nThe downtown cafe is the only one in Boston exclusively brewing Stumptown Coffee, named The Best Coffee in the World by NPR, The New York Times, Food &amp; Wine Magazine and USA Today, according to the Thinking Cup website. They also offer a variety of organic teas beyond just shoving a tea bag in boiling water.\n\n“I loved that the tea comes in little tea pots and you pour it into little tea cups,” Shea Gomez, a freshman musical theatre major, said. “They don’t use tea bags and it’s really fresh and cute.”\n\nThe Thinking Cup’s owner, Hugh Geiger, went to New England School of Law in the mid-90s and knows the Downtown area well.\n“I thought that a cozy coffee shop would do well. We came up with the name, ‘Thinking Cup’  because we thought that it would be a good idea to come up with a concept that provokes thought,” Geiger said in an e-mail to the Beacon. All the buzz is duly deserved, as their silky smooth brew is the milk and honey of coffees.\n\nUnfortunately for every foodie on a meal plan, your parents can’t fund your inevitable Stumptown Coffee addiction as the Thinking Cup does not accept ECCash yet. Geiger said in an e-mail to the Beacon that they wanted to but Emerson did not permit it. “As it relates to ECCash, we were denied access.  I find it interesting.  I assume we are a threat to the cafe that you guys have,” Geiger said. Hold off on donning your picketing gear, though. According to Andrew Mahoney, Director of Business Services’ e-mail to the Beacon, the matter is still under consideration.\n\n<em>*Food:</em>\nClassic sandwiches like peppercorn turkey and smoked salmon can quash any famine and cost between seven and 10 dollars. For those looking for a lighter alternative, or perhaps reminiscing about European portion sizes, a 6-inch baguette stuffed with tuna or turkey and cheese costs less than five dollars.\n\nAll fans of Panera’s broccoli cheddar should prepare to be blown away by Thinking Cup’s tomato cheddar. The 12-ounce serving for five bucks is more than enough to feel full, but when combined with one of their cheddar and bacon breakfast scones it’s an ultimate cure for those winter chills.\n\n<em>*Desserts:</em>\nFinally, Finale has met its match. Delicate biscotti, fresh fruit tarts in a light custard, exquisite chocolate mousse, buttery coconut macaroons, cupcakes in all shades of frosting and a variety of sizes, and cakes by the slice that will make even the most devout weight watcher throw away the calorie counter. These goodies range in prices from a little over a dollar to five depending on the item.\n\n<em>*Atmosphere:</em>\nThe Thinking Cup’s interior provides the best of both worlds for those looking for a quiet place to read or study and a relaxed atmosphere to spend some time with friends. It’s not the best place to answer e-mails however, as there is no WiFi.\n“I immediately felt like I was in the country,” James Harness, sophomore broadcast journalism major said. “It was like a hybrid between a country bakery and a city cafe.”\n\nThe decoration of the cafe combines intimate lighting imperative to providing that relaxing anonymity previously reserved exclusively for romantic restaurants with unrefined details like one brick wall and chalkboard menus. Each tabletop displays a different vintage newspaper local to Boston behind a thick glass. One is the front page of the July 22, 1969 Boston Herald Traveler covering Neil A. Armstrong and Edwin E. Aldrin Jr.’s return from their lunar landing, while another is the morning edition of the Boston Sunday Globe from February 16, 1896 featuring a “Pictorial History of a Century of Cycling.” The rest of the decor consists of delicious goodies in glass cases and jars.\n\nSheel Ganatra, a grad student at MIT and a coffee aficionado, finds himself a regular here.\n\n“I keep coming back because I consistently find it very good. Good coffee, good location, and good hours ,which is rare in the Boston area to say the least,” Ganatra said. And it’s true! The Thinking Cup is open as late as 10 p.m. Monday — Thursday and until 11 p.m. Friday — Sunday. Between its accommodating hours and proximity to campus, it’ll be hard not to find yourself going back.\n\n&nbsp;","dt":"2011-01-27 02:10:14 -0500"},"346":{"terms":[{"id":12,"name":"Auntie Em"},{"id":5,"name":"Lifestyle"}],"title":"Anal Gratification","body":"<div>Dear Auntie Em,I’m a male at Emerson who has only ever been with females and thoroughly enjoys sex with them.

He has it nice. He can’t even appreciate what he has.\n\nSo, with that, I’ve got a message for all the Patriots fans that for some reason can’t be happy with their freakin’ 99: watch the Super Bowl.\n\nI know your beloved gridiron pantheons weren’t as successful this season as you hoped for, but that should not inhibit you from watching what is shaping up to be one of the best sporting spectacles in recent memory.\n\nThere are too many subplots and intriguing storylines to tune out and watch whatever re-runs competing networks might peddle that night.\n\nFrom a stylistic standpoint, this game will be unlike any Super Bowl played since the early 90s. Back when Lawrence Taylor was flying around the field on one side, and Darryl Talley, Shane Conlan, and Cornelius Bennett (the three AFC Pro Bowl linebackers) were on the other — also known as Super Bowl XXV.\n\nThis Super Bowl, like the aforementioned New York Giants vs. Buffalo Bills contest of 1991, features two smashmouth, dynamic defenses that play in your face, loud, abrasive football. Simply put, they play football the right way.\n\nThe saying goes, “defense wins championships.” Well, these two teams boast championship caliber defenses, with the Steelers and Packers allowing the fewest and second fewest points respectively, this season in the NFL. Get ready for a doozy.\n\nThere is no shortage of big names on the defensive side of the ball, either. Guys like Clay, Hawk, Farrior, and Woodson, the kind of names you would only normally hear on Ben Stiller’s dodge ball team.\n\nThis matchup features the classic battle of the, veteran “been there — done that” quarterback in Ben Roethlisberger versus the “up-and-comer” Aaron Rodgers.\n\nRodgers, the quarterback who replaced Brett Favre in 2008,  has finally taken the Pack to football’s grandest stage. By comparison, it took Favre four years to reach the Super Bowl (and 16 years to expose his genatalia via text), while Rodgers reached the big game in just three years (and has yet to bare all by his phone). A Super Bowl win for A-Rodge could mean permanently coming out of Favre’s football shadow, and garnering the respect he deserves.\n\nLet’s not forget: the last time the Packers won the Super Bowl was 1997, and they came just one win short of another Lombardi trophy the following year in 1998, long before iPhones and ‘sexting’ were even invented. Green Bay is craving a title.\n\nAnd for history’s sake, let’s not forget who the Pack defeated in 1997… those Bill Parcells-led Pats.\n\nPittsburgh, on the other hand, has enjoyed immense success as of late. Winning Super Bowls in 2005 and 2008, the Steelers are the second most successful team in recent memory behind… ahem, your Foxborough gods.\n\nThis is a rare opportunity for the football fanatics of the Commonwealth to watch a game in January/February objectively, which can lead to more enjoyment. Just think; you don’t have to hold your breath every time Brady’s Beiber-cut gets ruffled, or when Belichick decides to go for it on fourth down from his own five yardline.\n\nTake it from a New York Giants fan: watching post-season football with no vested interest can potentially open up a world of viewing enjoyment.\n\nUnfortunately, this game will be played in the comfort of Cowboys Stadium, in the good ol’ Longhorn state. A snowy backdrop could have turned this insta-classic into an all-timer, but we’ll have to make do.\n\nMaybe you are still  depressed, and have not left your room since that dreadful Sunday. Maybe some of you are reading this from the sanctity of the rock you’re hiding under until the NFL season kicks off next September. But if you consider yourself a football fan, this is a game you’re not going to want to miss.

But head coach Bill Gould suggested it was much more, a sign the Lions were finally pulling out of an early season slump.\n\n“We’re gaining confidence,” Gould said. “It didn’t matter who we were losing to. If we played the [Los Angeles] Lakers 30 times and went 0-30, we’d still be discouraged. But now we’re winning.”\n\nThe Lions season began with three matchups versus Top 25 Division 3 womens teams. However, after that tough stretch, Emerson’s schedule decreased in difficulty, including a recent conference stretch.\n\nThe Johnson and Wales win was the Lions’ fourth in its last four GNAC matchups, catapulting the team into a third place tie in the GNAC with Norwich University, and one game behind conference leaders Emmanuel College.\n\nWith only six conference games remaining on the Lions schedule, the team is in the thick of a tight race for the top spot in the conference.\n“We moved the ball really well today,” Gould said, whose team dished out 18 assists on 25 field goals.\n\nThe Lions dominated in every facet of the game, scoring on the fast break, in the low post, and off perimeter shots.\n\n“[Johnson and Wales] is a team that likes to get back and set up on defense,” said Gould, who urged his team to run the fast break many times throughout the first half following defensive rebounds.\n\nWhen the buzzer sounded and the first half was over, consecutive three-pointers in the last 30 seconds by Amy Sherman, and Shannon Norton (at the buzzer) extended Emerson’s lead to 16, its largest of the half.\n\nJohnson and Wales didn’t show any signs of life as the second half began, and an energized Emerson squad took full advantage stretching the lead to 31 before the game ended.\n\n“The message was still the same before the game,” said Gould. “It’s not who we’re playing; it’s what we’re playing.”\n\nAs Emerson continues to reel in the victories, players have noticed a boost in morale in the locker room.\n\n“Hopefully we can carry this confidence into games against better conference teams,” said DiNucci, who rang in a game- high 23 points, including seven three-pointers.\n\n“They were running a zone which is just asking a shooter to shoot,” said DiNucci, who had many wide-open looks throughout the second half with no defenders in sight. “I practice shooting without getting guarded, so I guess I have no excuse.”\n\nAnd while Emerson controlled the game behind DiNucci’s efforts, it was a well-rounded Emerson attack that proved to be too much for the Wildcats.\n\nKathy Andrade contributed yet another double-double with 20 points and 10 rebounds, and Shannon Norton continued to impress her coach coming off the bench to tally 16 points, and lead the Lions in minutes played at 31.\n\n“Shannon Norton stepped up,” said Gould. “I hate to say it, but you expect those games from DiNucci and Kathy. They’re great players.”","dt":"2011-02-03 00:51:18 -0500"},"172":{"terms":[{"id":9,"name":"Sports"}],"title":"Lions’ shortest player aims high in new position","body":"<strong>Catey Stahl, Beacon Correspondent</strong>\n\nNext time you come out for an Emerson women’s basketball game, look for jersey number four. Pink laces accenting purple Nikes and hair straightened to perfection make Emerson’s new point guard stand out.\n\nThe sophomore from Toronto, Ontario plays basketball. In a land usually dominated by ice hockey, Amy Sherman is an exception.\n“We’re a basketball family,” said Sherman, a sophomore communication studies major. “Most Canadian families are hockey families, but that’s not us.”\n\nAnother thing that sets Sherman apart is her height. She stands at a mere 5-foot-1.\n\n“Being short is completely out of my control, so I just have to deal with it and adjust,” Sherman said. “I feel that it gives me another challenge, and I have to do other things to compensate for that. I just try to be pretty scrappy and into my head thinking-wise rather than the physicality of it.”\n\nSherman has started all 18 games this season for the Lions and is one of the leaders on her team in steals and scoring.\n“She’s the shortest player on our team, but in the game against Salve Regina, by halftime she was leading the team in rebounds,” Madeline Smeaton, a freshman teammate said.\n\nSherman was introduced to athletics at an early age by her father, Doug Sherman.\n“He really introduced me to sports and how they can really positively influence your life and create and install morals and values in you,” Sherman said. “Not only do you become in good shape but what you learn on the court or on the field and take it into your everyday life, that’s what I really want to thank him for.”\nSherman said before her father introduced sports into her life, she had different dreams.\n“I wanted to be a ballerina,” Sherman said. “I would go to ballet class, but I really wasn’t graceful enough to be a ballerina. So then I tried tap dancing because that was a little less graceful and more bouncy, but I wasn’t great at that either. So I gave basketball a shot, and I felt that was more me.”\nIf Sherman was still attempting to grace the stage in pink satin shoes, then the basketball team would be without what head coach Bill Gould describes as a key player on the team. This season, Gould said, she’s been able to switch positions successfully, helping the Lions reshuffle their lineup.\nThe Lions’ point guard from last season, Jackie Williams,  now attends Johns Hopkins University, and Sherman has filled her role.\n“Our old point guard transferred, and Amy is familiar with our system,” Gould said. “She really understands what we are trying to do, and she does a real nice job with that. She’s more of a shooter and can distribute the ball well.”\nSherman is not completely unfamiliar with the point position. She ran the offense at Community Hebrew Academy of Toronto.\n“I played point in high school,” Sherman said. “The adjustment to college level is different, but I enjoy it and I love passing the ball to my teammates and seeing them be successful.”\nIt was Sherman’s hard work ethic in high school that earned her MVP four years in a row and captain for two years. According to Gould, she continues to stand out.\n“It’s kind of a cliché, but very true in this case: she’s a great kid,” Gould said. “A hard worker, and it seeps through to the rest of the team.”\nHer teammates agree. “I look up to her,” Smeaton said. “She’s very serious about her game and dedicated to improving our team. If I don’t know, I look to Amy. If the captain’s not here, I look to Amy.”\nSherman is still positive about grabbing a Great Northeast Athletic Conference championship this year despite the Lions’ young team. The team is currently 7-12 (5-1, GNAC).\nWhile Sherman said she still has a strong work ethic, she credits her father for where she is today.\n“I think parents are really big influences on your lives,” Sherman said. “That fact that my dad didn’t really push me towards sports but instead he opened my eyes to what they are. I don’t think I would have had the same relationship with sports if he didn’t show me.”","dt":"2011-02-03 01:01:50 -0500"},"173":{"terms":[{"id":9,"name":"Sports"}],"title":"College hires new interim men’s basketball coach","body":"<strong>Gabe Souza, Beacon Staff</strong>\n\n<!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 15.0px Arial} -->Last fall, after over 25 years of roaming the sidelines, Lynn Ramage decided to take a break from coaching basketball. The 53-year-old said he wanted to focus on getting his master’s degree in executive leadership and management through an online program at Liberty University, based out of Lynchburg, Va.\n\nBut when he saw a head coaching vacancy for men’s basketball at Emerson last week, he jumped at the opportunity.\n\n“I saw the situation and put in for it,” Ramage said. “I sent my resumé up and offered my services as soon as I could.”\n\nJust two weeks ago, Ramage said he was grilling steaks in the warmth of his Greensboro, N.C. home. Now, while he is admittedly a bit colder, he is excited to be the Lions’ third head coach this season.\n\nThe Lynchburg, Va. native took over for Stan Nance, the associate director of athletics. Nance had coached the previous four games after Hank Smith suddenly departed the head coaching position on Jan. 21.\n\nSmith, a 16-year veteran, guided the team for just over one-half of the season until the college made the decision to no longer have him lead the squad.\n\nRamage, who will continue to work on his degree, has a career college record of 108-121 with time spent at four different schools, according to NCAA records.\n\nHis most successful season came in 1999-00 when he guided Connecticut College to a 19-5 mark and was named the New England Small College Athletic Conference coach of the year.\n\nRamage’s experience ranges from Division 3 schools like Connecticut College to noted Division 1 programs such as Morgan State (1994-95) and University of North Carolina-Greensboro (2002-04).\n\nMost recently Ramage was the head coach of Halifax County High School in South Boston, Va. There, he guided the Comets to an overall record of 33-30, including two 12-win seasons, according to the Gazette-Virginian, a newspaper in the area.\n\nThe coach said the Emerson vacancy was big news.\n\n“People knew about this all the way to California,” Ramage said. “I think this is one of the better jobs in New England. It’s as good as any and better than most. I’ve coached in the NESCAC and this is just as good. I’m just happy to be here.”\n\nRamage said his plan for Emerson basketball is simple.\n\n“I would like to get these seniors to play as many games as we can,” he said. “That’s what we said in the locker room here just a few minutes ago. We would like for you to go out in the best way possible. The kids have been very receptive to me so far, and I really appreciate that.”\n\nPlayers seemed pleased with their new coach.\n\n“I like Lynn right now,” said Bilali Mack, a sophomore animation major. “He’s been motivational for us, telling us to keep our heads up and things like that.”Junior forward Carlos Negrete agreed.\n\n“So far, so good,” said Negrete, a broadcast journalism major. “His practices have been pretty mellow, and it’s definitely nice that he’s trying to support us and he’s understanding the situation.”\n\nBut while early returns on Ramage’s coaching style were positive, the situation proved difficult for many players.\n\n“It’s pretty hard man,” Mack said. “It’s the third coach we’ve had this season. I don’t even know if this has ever happened to any basketball program before. It’s pretty hard; we’re a strong team, and we’ll play hard. But we don’t really know what happened with our coach, and we try to move on and keep it about basketball. Coach Hank [Smith] taught us how to fight.”\n\nSmith’s departure sparked controversy after the college originally said he had left “to pursue other interests.” But just a few days after the statement was released, William P. Gilligan, the vice president of information technology who oversees athletics for President Jacqueline Liebergott, said the college had a hand in his exit, but gave no reason for the decision.\n\nSmith has not been reached for comment.\n\nRamage will guide his new team for the first time tonight in an in-conference matchup at Mount Ida College. Negrete said that while his team is looking forward to the challenge, it will take some getting used to.\n\n“It’s pretty tough, I’ve never gone through a coaching change midseason in my entire life playing basketball, so for it to happen a third time, well, it’s kind of strange,” Negrete said. “It’ll take a lot of getting used to. We are going to have to kind of feel our way through.”\n\nRamage said he’s not going to try to change anything drastically, but rather focus on the system that’s already in place.\n\n“We’ll keep it the way it is,” Ramage said. “Just navigating the ship that’s already in place. If it ain’t broke, why fix it?”\n\n&nbsp;","dt":"2011-02-03 01:05:01 -0500"},"174":{"terms":[{"id":7,"name":"Opinion"}],"title":"Reflecting on Obama’s State of the Union speech","body":"<strong>Sarah Betancourt, <strong>Beacon Contributor</strong></strong>\n\nOn Jan. 20, 2009, President Obama announced a \"new era of responsibility.” It is unfounded and impetuous for anyone to conclude that the past two years have been a letdown for the American people. It is easy for us to acknowledge the failed policies of the eight year Bush administration, and to sweep them under the carpet without recognizing the implications they have had on the current administration. It is even easier to discount success and highlight failure.  No President since the time of FDR has dealt with such conflict and responsibility, and handled it with the ability worthy of the title of Commander-in-Chief.\n\nBy January of 2009, GDP had fallen at the fastest rate in a quarter-century. Seven hundred thousand jobs were being lost each month. According to the budget summary for FYI 2011, the financial crisis of 2008 had let $5,000,000,000,000.00 of Americans’ households' wealth disappear in 3 months as stock values plummeted.This led to record foreclosure rates and declining home values.\n\nObama's most pressing problem is that he has to alleviate the minds of the American people who are misled daily by the bold-faced lies of those in power.\n\nThe GOP wanted to extend the tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans in order to allow the top wage earners to reinvest their money in the economy. While Don’t Ask Don’t Tell and the Dream Act were being \"held hostage\" by the GOP in December, Obama extended his hand in an act of bipartisanship and sacrificed his political clout. He called for the extension of tax cuts for the 2 percent of wealthiest Americans for the good of the other 98 percent who were about to lose enormous funds for programs in health care, education, and small business growth. According to the National Employment Law Project, 2.25 million Americans would have continued to struggle to put food on the table without the extension.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office states that repealing the health care law would worsen the federal deficit over the next 10 years, by $230 billion. Yet, the House Republican leadership misrepresents this CBO report which actually says that the amount of labor used in the economy will decrease by a small amount because of (and here’s the important part) people retiring and cutting back their own hours. The GOP insists that the bill would cut 1.6 million jobs, but falsely cites an employer mandate that is not actually in the bill. This is often misconstrued because Speaker Boehner claims he wants to remove barriers to job growth, as cited in the Pledge to America taken by the GOP. However, how can this be done with a \"job-killing bill,\" that actually perpetuates the very thing it claims to be against?\n\nSo how does President Obama contend to the inaccuracies of the messaging of the GOP, the precarious support of his base who still want more progressive policies, and the weary American public? With a State of the Union speech.\n\nTo assuage the fears of those concerned with the national deficit, Obama proposed a five-year freeze on all discretionary spending. While many Republicans are underwhelmed by this proposal, it is imperative to remember that cutting more would effect our quest to be internationally competitive. We must acknowledge Obama’s proposals in the major cuts in defense spending, the enforcement of the Troubled Asset Relief Program, the abolition of earmarks, and the proposed elimination of billions of taxpayer money given to oil companies. Defense cuts alone will save $400 billion over the next decade. All of these reign in the costs of government spending while holding Congress accountable.\n\nAlthough I do care about the deficit, I care more about the competitiveness of the United States and the jobs that will be created upon the rise of US productivity. In 2010 alone, there was a rise of 10.5 percent in exports of goods and services. Obama is proposing a tax credit for companies that undertake research and has set a goal that 80 percent of the nation's electricity will come from clean energy sources by 2035. In order to attain anything near that goal, we will  need educated engineers. With a lack of able engineers to work in this new field, we must provide incentives toward educating all of those held back by the rising cost of education.\n\nIf we can focus on the President's call to innovation in education, clean energy, and transportation infrastructure, our economy would not only be stable-it would be booming.\n\nThe Republican response to the State of the Union, given by Rep. Paul Ryan, focused on reigning in spending, but offered no plans to create jobs. Instead of putting the money where his mouth is, he touts the \"symbolic\" call for repeal of health care reform (which won't pass in the Senate), while millions in tax payers' money are being wasted for every hour spent in meaningless debate on repealing the health care bill.\n\nConsidering this, the President must walk the fine line of pleasing his base and pleasing the party of \"no.\" As he does, we must weigh the benefits and costs of the polarized philosophies of Democrats and Republicans. Is it best to reign in the costs of sizable but necessary spending at the cost of our innovation? Could the ambitious propositions in energy policy and education re-establish our position as the world superpower and put Americans back to work? I leave these questions for you to decide.","dt":"2011-02-03 01:07:15 -0500"},"175":{"terms":[{"id":7,"name":"Opinion"}],"title":"NFL owners’ foul play","body":"<strong>Wade Fink, Beacon Contributor</strong>\n\nWhat a fitting venue: The royal palace of Jerry Jones’ kingdom, Cowboys stadium, will be the home of Superbowl XLV.  More than 100,000 are expected to pack the stadium on game day.\n\nBut there is one aspect of this year’s Super Bowl that many tend to ignore, and that’s the chance that this stadium could be the burial ground for the sport we love.\n\nAn estimated $9 billion operation could be torn down by Jones and his fellow team owners if an agreement is not reached with the National Football League Players’ Association (NFLPA).  The owners want serious concessions from the 2006 collective bargaining agreement, an agreement the players, perhaps mistakenly, admitted was a “great deal.”  Owners want concessions on an array of issues, most notably an 18-game regular season, a rookie salary cap, and a pay cut in the players’ share of revenue.\n\nIf March 3rd comes and goes without an agreement in place, National Football League (NFL) owners will lock out their employees and endanger next year’s season.\n\nAt stake are thousands of jobs and small businesses across the country.  For many, their very livelihoods are at risk. Bars, restaurants, and other businesses in NFL cities depend heavily on Sundays, as do stadium employees and parking lot operators.\n\nA study released last month by Edgeworth Economics highlights the potential impact of a canceled NFL season.  The study purports that every city with an NFL franchise stands to lose about $160 million in revenue, $5 billion total, and an aggregate of 115,000 jobs. The study was commissioned by the NFLPA.\n\n“They don’t care, and that’s our concern here,” said George Atallah, assistant executive director of external affairs for the NFLPA, in an interview with the Beacon. “They have made no consideration for [the people affected].”\n\nAnd that is the simple truth: The owners do not care about the ramifications of this lockout.  It’s as though we’re all collateral damage, from Peyton Manning to the local busboy at MJ O’Connors. The owners want more money. Period.\n|\nNFL spokesman Greg Aiello calls this study a “fairy tale” on the NFL Labor site.\n\nI invited Mr. Aiello or anyone from the NFL to comment directly to the Beacon. Instead, I was sent an email that linked to an article on the NFL labor website.\n\n“Are you going to support a family on selling parking tickets or beer?” Professor Robert Baade, asked in the NFL article, cited to undercut the validity of Edgeworth’s analysis.\n\nWhat an egregious comment. One cannot be more out of touch.  The answer is yes, Professor, thousands do.  And further, for many, it is a second or third job in an attempt to make ends meet.  For them, it’s not about how to pay for a Tom Brady jersey, it’s how to keep the lights and heat on in their homes.\n\nAnd, in the public discourse that is a constant reminder of how little these owners care about actual people, their response to this study is a fine microcosm. No numbers.  No facts. Just incredibly lazy rhetoric.\n\nThe NFL owners have yet to offer a commensurate study.  But they have, ironically, provided the numbers for Edgeworth’s study.\n“The NFL has yet to acknowledge that this study is derived from economic numbers they present to municipalities for tax subsidies,” Atallah said.\n\nThat’s right. The basis for Edgeworth’s study were the NFL’s own numbers, which were used in various pitches to cities across the country for why tax subsidies, to offset the cost of building new stadiums, would benefit the community economically.  The NFL’s pitch to the cities focused on creating jobs, tax revenue, and, overall, the basic rationale for the city to desire an NFL team and stadium.  That is public record. Now the NFL is ignoring the very facts that they themselves presented. They have been hoisted by their own petard.\nClaiming to be suffering economically, with costs rising and revenues not keeping up, the owners have refused to open their books for analysis. But by simply showing, line-by-line, what their expenses are and what their income is, they would seemingly end the debate.  In past labor negotiations, the National Basketball Association (NBA) owners opened their books to the union. The National Hockey League (NHL) has done so in the past. The precedent is there and yet the owners refuse.\n\n“Were not asking for anything.  We didn’t opt-out of the deal,” Atallah said. “We’ve asked them to share their financial information and they’ve said no.”\n\nSadly, they don’t need public support to lock out the players, cut thousands of jobs, and kill small businesses. The owners have the economic leverage to win this war, as they have horded billions to survive a cancelled season.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t be concerned. The public perception is that this fight is between millionaire players and billionaire owners. It’s not. The owners and players will survive. It is the working stiffs, ordinary Americans that will be affected by the owners bullying tactics. Wasn’t that the reason for unions in the first place?\n\nThe NFL owners don’t care, but I’m angry.  And you should be too.","dt":"2011-02-03 01:12:51 -0500"},"176":{"terms":[{"id":7,"name":"Opinion"}],"title":"We need honest grading","body":"<strong>Richard West, Beacon Contributor</strong>\n\nAs a 26-year teaching veteran, I agree with those who claim that there is a grade inflation problem in academia today. Across the country, many college classrooms are filled with students who know that regardless of participation, they’ll “earn” an A or B if they just make it to the end of the term.\n\nNearly every student at Emerson has completed the College’s Instructor Evaluation Form. While all categories on the form are important to me, each semester, I think item 10 sticks out: “The Instructor presented material at an appropriate level of difficulty.”\n\nThough some may quibble about the weight I place on this category, this evaluative item best reflects student perceptions of classroom rigor. As I look at the responses to this category from last fall (62.5% of my students rated me “in the middle”), and as I review my final grade distribution, I wonder if I challenged my students sufficiently.\n\nWe can all agree there are many measures of classroom rigor. But what you may not agree with is my belief that rigor is associated with grade distribution. On several occasions, students have written in the Beacon about grade inflation and classroom rigor. But so far, I’ve read nothing from a faculty perspective regarding these critical areas in education.\n\nA few weeks ago, I overheard the following in the Little Building dining hall: “I have a friend at Harvard who told me that she slept during her class almost every Tuesday morning, and she still got a B in the class” (repeated here verbatim).\n\nMy next-door neighbor is the HR Director for a large financial institution in Boston. She told me the other day that she pretty much disregards graduating seniors’ grade points (unless they’re terrible) since it’s “common knowledge” in the corporate world that colleges are giving out undeserved As and Bs.\n\nGrade inflation is what I call a transactional problem. Both professors and students co-create a situation whereby high grades are being passed out to undeserving students. At times, some professors give sub-par students high grades and at other times, some students aim low and work toward achieving the minimum level expected of them in the class.\n\nTeaching and learning need to be so much more.\n\nHere’s what I know: First, I realize that the vast majority of professors and students are doing their best to ensure academic integrity on the Emerson campus. Yet, despite Emerson being a school with a rather selective admission process, scores of students have received a higher grade than they deserved. Heck, I’m sure I’m guilty of this practice myself. There are some courses on this campus where students receive As and Bs because they’ve acquired the necessary competencies (e.g., internships, directed studies, etc.). But what about other courses?\n\nColleagues: If you are not doing it now, you should consciously ensure that learning standards are met for each of your students. And, as I try to do on a regular basis, grading should be done with discernment. There is a difference between awarding an A to a student who is meeting the course objectives and a student who is excelling in them. When we grade more strictly, it’s likely that students will rise to the standards set. Finally, as my colleague ­— a dean at a private school in the Midwest ­— contends, no professor should distribute high grades because students are paying high tuition. We might as well toss in the teaching towel if we operate with this assumption.\nStudents: What exactly do you hope to get out of a class if you’re simply sitting in the course absorbing the atmosphere without contributing to it? The classroom is a shared experience between you and the professor. If you complain about the lack of rigor and the “easy A,” you should also figure out if you’ve done anything to make the class a more challenging experience. What standards of excellence do you bring into a course? Submit your best work with each assignment. And, when you receive a grade—other than an A—take it as a learning opportunity.\n\nClearly, I don’t believe that high grades in a class must mean it was a blow off for students. But, despite the various views on this topic, every compelling discussion of education addresses the interplay between grades and a class that stretches the mind and engages the academic soul.\n\nWhile teachers may become more honest graders and students become more attentive learners, all of us on this campus need to begin a candid dialogue about what is happening with grades around here and the various levels of interpretation surrounding them.\nAs I continue to focus on improving my teaching, I must also continue to think about my grades and student perceptions of the difficulty of my class. I refuse to be a teacher who teaches classes where students simply regurgitate back facts from a yellow-highlighted textbook. On the other hand, I don’t want to be a teacher where students look confused or disengaged because the material is beyond their grasp or the content has little resonance.-\n\nI want to be someone whom students view as accessible, interesting, and yes, challenging. I aspire to provide students the grades they deserve, hoping that those grades reflect a course and an instructor with appropriate classroom standards.","dt":"2011-02-03 01:17:10 -0500"},"179":{"terms":[{"id":7,"name":"Opinion"}],"title":"Improve yourself by improving your community","body":"<strong>Sara Prescott, <strong>Beacon Contributor</strong></strong>\n\nFlip through any student planner these days, and you will see class scheduled Monday through Thursday, scattered internship hours, student organization meetings, and sometimes a part-time job over the weekend. Emersonians are a busy bunch, but I can’t help thinking something is missing from the typical weekly schedule.\n\nTake a walk downtown and you will find several homeless shelters. Venture out of our three-block radius and you can find an understaffed community project. Emerson is located in an area of Boston in need of action by its local students. Just look around and it becomes obvious what that weekly planner needs.\nCommunity service is more beneficial than many of the internships students undertake. The responsibility placed on volunteers is much heavier than on interns. A community service volunteer is usually necessary to the success of the project. Their suggestions are taken into consideration by superiors; compare that to the menial work interns are delegated.\nRather than go through the motions at an internship, be the action. Dedicate your time and work to produce something meaningful, rather than pick up where the last intern left off. As an intern, you are often not missed once your replacement arrives.\n\nCommunity service is beneficial for your social and professional life, and no, not only in the sappy context. Community service equips you with certain traits, knowledge, and abilities, making you more marketable to employers. Volunteers are required to have self-initiative and resourcefulness as well as critical and creative skills for their service work. Participating in community service allows for introspection and encourages a person to be more understanding of others.\nSuzanne Hinton, the associate director of the Office for Service Learning and Community Action, reported that in 2010, 1,800 Emerson students clocked 51,000 total service hours. These hours were valued at approximately $1,457,000 for local communities, given that the 2010 value of a Massachusetts service hour was $28.52.\nOf those 1,800 participants, 51 students were enrolled in the Jumpstart program and were responsible for 14,515 hours themselves. According to my calculations, students not involved with Jumpstart dedicated 21 hours each over the course of the year. In the time it takes to watch season one of Buffy the Vampire Slayer again, you could volunteer and generate nearly $600 for the local community.\nMy experience with community service dates back to middle school. I started  working with the local Special Olympics team by shadowing the athletes during practices and games. This lead to my involvement with the Walk for Autism in Boston and Manchester, which connected me to helping clean up public parks, collecting can donations for food banks and later serving at shelters in Downtown Crossing.\nThe early exposure only encouraged me to participate more, and I know I have reaped the benefits from my involvement. I have a better understanding of the diversity and complexities of the world, and have directed my future career path in the nonprofit sector.\nCommunity service doesn’t need to be local, though. World Hunger reported in 2010 there were 925 million people living hungry. The World Health Organization states that approximately 100 to 140 million girls and women have been victim to female genital mutilation. Just because we do not bear witness to the issues affecting our global community does not mean they do not exist.\nRather than spending a couple of hours Facebook stalking the seemingly attractive and mysterious fellow in your Costume and Make-up Design class or wasting an entire afternoon going through @Lord_Voldermort7’s Twitter comments, get involved with an issue you take interest in. Do you want to lower the homeless population in Boston? Would you like to reduce Emerson’s “carbon footprint”? Maybe you could get the attractive, mysterious fellow to join you and fit something new into those gaps in your weekly planner.","dt":"2011-02-03 01:32:39 -0500"},"293":{"terms":[{"id":7,"name":"Opinion"}],"title":"Whose work is it anyway?","body":"<h1><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-size: 13px;\"><strong>Morgan Baker, Beacon Columnist</strong></span></h1>\n<div><strong>\n</strong></div>\n<div>When I started teaching, lo those many years ago, I knew there were some aspects of the job I wouldn’t be fond of: the pay, the occasional whiny student,  and sometimes, the papers I had to correct — especially when these papers piled into mountains by my desk, on my desk, on the chair and on the floor near my desk.</div>\n<div>\n\nThe pressure to return those papers in a timely fashion added to my stress. Not only did some students nag, I knew students couldn’t improve on their future work without seeing how they had done on their past work. Don’t get me wrong: students should expect papers back in a reasonable amount of time. You, and your parents, are paying good money for my services, and I should provide them. Read that again: I should provide them.\n\nWhat I discovered from last spring’s issue of the Chronicle of Higher Education is that some professors (hopefully not at Emerson) don’t have the time or inclination to correct their papers because their classes are too big or they’d rather spend their time on research or with students in the classroom.\n\nWho wouldn’t? That’s the fun stuff. So they’re outsourcing their papers — not to their TAs, because even they can’t handle the workload — but to where most outsourcing goes: to Asia.\nIf I can’t handle my workload, I can hire Virtual-TA, a subsidiary of EduMetry, Inc., in Virginia to help me. According to its website, the company trains many Masters and PhDs in multiple subjects to correct papers using rubrics — something else I detest. Writing should be original, not written to a rubric. Both websites made me want to puke as a parent and a professor.\n\nAs a parent, I assume when my daughter signs up for particular teachers, they’ll be correcting her papers — not someone who doesn’t know what she looks like.\n\nStudents select teachers based on reputations they garner from past classes. They want to hear what their professors have to say in front of their class and on their papers.\n\nAs a professor, I’m nauseated. I correct my students’ papers. Maybe my students don’t always like what I have to say, and maybe I don’t always like doing it, but it’s part of my job description, and I do it even when I’d rather be doing other work or watching TV with my family. Generally, I enjoy reading those papers when I have the time and the mountains aren’t too high.\n\nIt’s not clear that only those who teach large classes are using these resources, but if classes are so big, and instructors are that overwhelmed, maybe colleges and universities should rethink class size so teachers can deliver on what they promised their constituents.\n\nProfessors, however, aren’t the only ones who are stressed. Students are too. Part of my responsibility is to model what I consider appropriate behavior. If I started outsourcing my work because I either have too much or I just don’t want to do it, would I then be encouraging you, the students, to outsource your work as well? According to the author of “The Shadow Scholar,” an article from the Chronicle of Higher Ed in November of last year, this kind of outsourcing is also a rising trend.\n\nThe author of that article is the one providing the services.  Writing under a pseudonym, he says he’s written thousands of application essays, theses, finished online courses in numerous subjects, and no one would be able to detect his work in a classroom because it’s all original.\nWhy go to school if you don’t want to take risks, improve, and see what you can learn in a classroom? It’s a colossal waste of time, energy, and money if you don’t put in the effort. Why do it? The only answer I can imagine is that students feel so much pressure these days to excel at everything, that they can’t run the risk of getting less than a perfect grade, let alone fail a class. So some outsource.\n\nI thought the point of college, however, was to experiment, to see what you’re good at and what you’re not so good at, what you like and what you don’t like. I took a history class in college, and trust me, that’s not my subject. I got less than a stellar grade, and I’m not talking a B either. Even at Emerson, where students often don’t have the opportunity to take courses outside their major, you can still experiment within your major or even within a class.\n\nWhat’s going to happen to students who don’t take risks and choose to outsource their work? What will they do when they graduate? How are they going to explain to their new bosses that they really aren’t as smart as they appear on paper?  “Oh sorry Mr./Ms. Boss, I didn’t really earn that A. My ghostwriter got it for me.”\n\nRegardless of the ethical issues around outsourcing, I’m mainly just sad. I’m sad that higher education is turning into a weird business where overworked teachers would even consider outsourcing, not just to TAs but to people who don’t even work in their schools. And, I’m especially sad some students are so stressed, that they’re not in school for the journey, but just for that glorious A — any way possible.\n\n</div>\n&nbsp;","dt":"2011-01-27 23:41:56 -0500"},"296":{"terms":[{"id":3,"name":"Arts &amp; Entertainment"}],"title":"With three guild wins, The King's Speech heats up Oscar race","body":"<!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 12.0px; font: 15.0px Arial} p.p2 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 16.0px Times; min-height: 19.0px} p.p3 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 15.0px Arial} --><strong>Hayden Wright, Beacon Staff</strong>\n\nThe Director’s Guild of America stunned the blogosphere when it bestowed Tom Hooper of <em>The King’s Speech</em> with its Best Director prize on January 29. Heavily favored  by most awards pundits was David Fincher, director of <em>The Social Network</em>, whose Oscar campaign appears to be losing steam by the day. Hooper’s win was regarded by most commentators as a seismic shift in the race for Best Picture, with many calling <em>The King’s Speech</em> a clear frontrunner.\n\nGranted, part of the fun of awards season are the moments of unpredictability. It is hard to characterize a constantly changing voting body exclusively by the decisions it has made in the past. Academy decisions can seem arbitrary and downright confusing, though it seems we never tire of speculating about the Oscars. And though there are eight other nominees, <em>The Social Network</em> and <em>The King’s Speech</em> are the only two to have won major precursors. Thus, the media has quickly turned this into a two-horse race.\n\nAnd <em>The King’s Speech</em>’s momentum has grown substantially. Hooper’s film also won at the Producer’s Guild Awards and Screen Actors Guild Awards. This was an unexpected turn, as many presumed <em>The Social Network</em> would dominate after receiving numerous critics’ awards and topping many year-end top 10 lists. It seemed to cruise to a Golden Globe win for Best Picture, a prestigious honor that is also deceptively unimportant when it comes to the Oscar race.\n\nThe Golden Globe for Best Picture has a spotty predictive history with the Academy. Globe winners as recent as <em>Avatar</em>, <em>Atonement</em>, <em>Babel</em>, <em>Brokeback</em> <em>Mountain</em>, and <em>The Aviator</em> failed to repeat at the Academy Awards. Unlike SAG, DGA, and PGA, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which determines the Golden Globes, has no membership overlap with the Academy.\n\nGuilds are comprised of members of the industry, whose fingers are almost always closer to the pulse of Hollywood than critical bodies like the Golden Globes. No Golden Globe winner in the past 20 years has gone on to win Best Picture at the Oscars without being endorsed by at least one of these guilds — <em>The Social Network</em> would be an unprecedented winner.\n\nHowever, perhaps SAG, PGA, and DGA’s decisions betray a deeper conservatism that permeates the most august corners of Hollywood — an unabashed love of old-fashioned filmmaking and a hesitancy to embrace edgier fare.\n\n<em>The King’s Speech</em>, an old-school adversity story about King George VI’s efforts to overcome his stammer, is by all definitions a classic piece of Oscar bait. The pedigreed cast and feel-good material (not to mention its prime location at the beginning of World War II) makes it exactly the type of film the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences goes nuts for.\n\nStagey period drama is an Oscar mainstay (think <em>Shakespeare in Love</em> and <em>The English Patient</em>) and <em>The King’s Speech</em> even won over critics who may have become cynical about stuffy period work. By most accounts, it is a vibrant and thoroughly entertaining piece of cinema, by any standards.\n\nOn the other hand, <em>The Social Network</em>, the story of Facebook’s founding, is rife with slimy techies who guzzle appletinis and demonstrate less loyalty than Benedict Arnold. The characters engage in quick, backstabbing courtroom banter, squabbling over billions like the whiny, entitled children they are. Its brilliant portrayal is perhaps too honest for Oscar: <em>Rolling Stone</em>’s Peter Travers and other critics insist that it “sums up the spirit of a generation.”\n\nIf that spirit is characterized by a simple lack of values, Oscar might not be ready to embrace it. And frankly, the innovation of its characters is overwhelmed by their sheer detestibility. Granted, the AMPAS has fawned over corrupt and spineless cultures in the past, but often within the context of a mobster or western fantasy. <em>The Social Network</em> then could be a little too honest, recent, and specific to our times.\n\n<em>The Social Network</em> may be a searing statement piece, but the loveliness of <em>The King’s Speech</em> can’t be denied. It received 12 Oscar nominations this year, more than any other film in competition, and four more than <em>The Social Network</em>’s eight. This disparity is made greater by the nominations Fincher’s film did not receive, like Best Supporting Actor honors for Andrew Garfield (who was nominated for most precursors).\n\nIt could be a clear sign that the odds are in Hooper’s favor for the big prize. Though, as the cliche goes, it’s an honor just to be nominated.\n\nThe 83rd Academy Awards will take place on Feb. 27, 2011 at 8 p.m. and are televised on ABC.\n\n&nbsp;","dt":"2011-02-03 00:18:12 -0500"},"297":{"terms":[{"id":3,"name":"Arts &amp; Entertainment"}],"title":"Shepard Fairy originals for sale on eBay","body":"<!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 12.0px; font: 15.0px Arial} p.p2 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 16.0px Times; min-height: 19.0px} p.p3 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 15.0px Arial} --><strong>Alicia Lazzaro, Beacon Correspondent</strong>\n\nBy coughing up a mere $100, you have the chance to own an original Shepard Fairey — or at least a piece of it.\n\nAn eBay vendor has listed a small piece of Fairey’s mural obtained from the Deitch Wall in New York City at a starting bid of $100. The mural was a mishmash of Fairey’s designs composed in his signature red hue. Even though just a piece of it is being sold, it represents a larger picture of Fairey’s work.\n\nAlong with peers like the elusive Banksy and quirky Invader, Shepard Fairey has made his way into the street-art scene. Fairey began his artistic career by replicating his designs on skateboards and T-shirts. His career was transformed when he burst onto the street art scene, plastering his work all over major cities in the country. Fairey is known for designing Barack Obama’s famous campaign poster. His signature mark, however, is the Andre the Giant Obey design, which can be seen in many forms all over the country splattered on the walls of buildings and pinned to street signs.\n\nDespite being illegal, or perhaps because of it, street art has accrued a major presence in the art world, as seen by the success of the documentary <em>Exit Through the Gift Shop</em>. It has transformed what some audiences would just label “graffiti” into a stand-alone art form. From posters to paintings to stickers, street art has become a prominent form of self-expression, usually with a political or social meaning behind it.\n\nThis development could have a lasting impact on the way art is sold. “Every artist needs to make a living. Fairey is an interesting example of an artist becoming adept at using the media,” said Judith Hull, architectural historian and Emerson art history professor. Online shopping has the potential to put artists on the map, especially street artists. This may legitimize street art for some disbelievers.\n\nThis may also impact the art world at large. Ownership of fine art will not be limited to those with deep pockets and the private jet to travel to an Italian gallery. The average art lover may not have $50,000 to spend on an original in an art gallery, but would be willing to drop $100 on a print just a click away on eBay.\n\n“eBay will put something up for sale and make it widely accessible, but it won’t serve the function of a broker,” said Hull. Selling art online may be working for Fairey, but it may not work for everyone. “Artists still need those brokers. Not all artists will make a living [selling their work] on eBay,” she said.\n\nSerious art buyers may question the authenticity of eBay, despite efforts to legitimize the online community. “People who buy from big auctions are buying for authentication.

This anniversary is one that owner and sole staffer Angela Sawyer sees as cause for celebration, considering the shop’s narrow appeal and the music industry’s shakiness.\n\nBut even from the start, Weirdo’s fittingly nontraditional journey has been a testament to the idea that even the most bizarre stuff has relevance and appeal in Boston’s culture.\n\nSawyer, who performs in several local experimental music acts, first started Weirdo in 2006 as nothing more than a website and a mailing list. But the project generated so much interest among Boston sub-cultural fanatics that she began allocating hours for people to browse records in her apartment. As Weirdo’s fanbase continued to grow, Sawyer eventually decided she needed more room.\n\nDespite some skeptical friends and her own low expectations, Sawyer continued with her plan for an actual storefront, and subsequently found herself once again shocked by the reaction. The store has become a hub for the Boston area’s experimental music scene, thanks not only to the rarity of its content, but also its essentially ever-open doors: Weirdo is even open on most holidays, when customers are frequently treated to snacks and screenings of obscure films.\n\nAnyone who has been inside Weirdo’s current location may have trouble believing that it was much\n\nof a spatial upgrade — the shop’s website does not exaggerate when it describes the store as “smaller than the average dorm room.” But Sawyer says it has made a big difference.\n\n“I had about this much room before, but I had a couch and television set,” she told the <em>Beacon</em>. “And roommates.”\n\nNow two years in and still thriving, Sawyer is preparing to celebrate both Weirdo’s success and the enthusiasm of Boston’s deep underground scene — from the esoterically-inclined record collectors, to the appreciators of rare cinema, to the local noise-creators and performers themselves — with a birthday concert.\n\nThe lineup for the Feb. 5 bash, in order to acknowledge the theme of “two,” comprises several duos — some of which have taken part in Weirdo’s Series on Mondays, the shop’s weekly program that draws in-store performances by artists whose niche appeal make them unbookable at many area venues.\n\nThe anniversary event will take place at the Whitehaus, a junk-covered Jamaica Plain residence that several area musicians call home, and it really couldn’t be anywhere else. The dwelling’s frequent house concerts and its dismantling of the traditional performer-audience dynamic have made the Haus a sort of counter-cultural Xanadu among Boston music fans. Though yowling, stomping hootenannies are the specialty, any outsider art — including free-form poetry, performance art, experimental film, and combinations of those three — has a place at the Whitehaus.\n\nWith the concert, Sawyer hopes to strike down barriers within the scene itself. The lineup — handpicked by Sawyer — features acts of deviating styles that usually wouldn’t be seen on the same bill. Indeed, Neptune’s homemade scrap-instruments and dizzying tremors of noise are a far cry from Cotton Candy’s whimsical and shiny power-pop.\n\nThe bill’s stark contrasts highlight a key message of Weirdo: that even the most outlying music can have a unifying power.\n\n“For the general population — people who only pay as much attention to music as I do to shirts — there’s this idea that this music is difficult,” Sawyer acknowledged. “I understand not everyone is going to be interested in a recording of someone banging their own head with a kitchen pot.”\n\nTo break down the stigma, Sawyer actively promotes an “unsnooty” attitude in the store. Listening to “weird” music, she says, isn’t about trying to be challenging: it’s about being open.\n\n“I’m most interested in not having fences inside my head about what I listen to,” she described. She sees herself in an ongoing quest to explore what makes a recording, regardless of genre or era, have quality. “I feel like that’s a project that anyone who wants to can work on.”\n\nAnd Weirdo Records seems like the ideal headquarters for that mission — everyone is welcome, they just might not be able to fit.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWeirdo Records (844 Massachusetts Ave., Cambridge) is open 11 A.M. to 9 P.M. all week long.\n\nThe shop will host its second birthday party at the Whitehaus (10 Seaverns Ave., Jamaica Plain) on Feb. 5.","dt":"2011-02-03 00:20:38 -0500"},"333":{"terms":[{"id":5,"name":"Lifestyle"}],"title":"Spring Cleaning","body":"<div>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-size: 13px;\"><strong>Jamie  Bogert, Beacon Staff</strong></span></h1>\nThat ugly sweater you wore this Christmas is ready to be put back in storage or donated to Goodwill.

The three floors, each cover the franchise’s various brands, including Forever 21, Heritage 1981, Love 21 and 21 Men.\n\n“It was overwhelming in the best way,” said Mykah Murphy, a marketing communication freshman.\n\nForever 21 may be a new face among the storefronts of Newbury Street, but the budget-friendly fashion franchise has been around since the 80s. With over 355 locations across the country, it’s one of the 50 largest privately owned companies in Los Angeles.\n\nHowever, the clothing store was not always the well-known fashion line it is today. Forever 21, once Fashion 21, opened its doors for the first time on April 21, 1984 on Figueroa Street in downtown LA. Its owners, Don Chang and his wife, Jin Sook, had immigrated to the US from South Korea in pursuit of the American Dream.\n\nToday, Forever 21 is a big fish in the “fast fashion” pond. Fast fashion focuses more on following the newest trends, whether they’re coming from big or small designers, but doing so on a budget. As a result, while paychecks dwindle and other stores struggle to clear out their inventory, customers flock to Forever 21.\n\n“I like the variety of options they supply,” said Lindsay Day, writing, literature, and publishing junior. “I’m just afraid to go because I spend all my money.” According to Forever 21’s profile on Yahoo! Finance, their top competitors in the fast fashion niche are Charlotte Russe and H&amp;M.\n\nForever 21 is no doubt a popular brand among many Emersonians. “It’s really cheap and really fashionable at the same time,” said Meaghan Barry, marketing communication junior.\n\nSince a 2004 campaign by PETA2, the younger generation of animal activists, Forever 21 even has animal lover appeal since it stopped selling designs made with animal fur.\n\nBut at the end of last year, Forever 21 made headlines for less favorable news. Major designers like Diane Von Furstenberg and Gwen Stefani filed lawsuits against the company for copying their designs and patterns. Most of the brand’s appeal however, lies in their ability to offer styles closely resembling those fresh off the Fashion Week catwalk, and squabbles likes these don’t seem to discourage shoppers from getting the most out of their buck. “Being fashionable at a cheaper price sounds very appealing to me,” said Murphy. “I’m not brand loyal so that makes me more inclined to shop at Forever 21.”\n\n&nbsp;","dt":"2011-02-03 02:13:11 -0500"},"336":{"terms":[{"id":5,"name":"Lifestyle"}],"title":"Dressing like a young professional","body":"<h1><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-size: 13px;\"><strong>Elizabeth Venere, Beacon Correspondent</strong></span></h1>\nResumé, check.\nCoffee, check.\nOutfit, yikes.\n\nTime for your first job interview, and you don’t have anything to wear that wasn’t purchased at Urban Outfitters. And if you do, getting that coffee stain out will take forever.\n\nSure, as an Emersonian you’re most likely up-to-date on all the latest runway trends, but do those really translate into acceptable interview and internship ensembles? How do you dress like a young professional?\n\nSince most of us do not have Stacy London or Clinton Kelly, the hosts of What Not To Wear, on speed dial, the Beacon sound some guidelines.\n\n“The first thing anyone should do is research the company,” said Jason Guttilla, president of the Emerson College Fashion Society. “That’s going to determine the dress code.”\n\nGuttilla said the interview outfit should never be flashy. Shoot for conservative. His advice for Emerson guys interning in any of the college’s fields: slacks and a button down shirt with a tie. He also said to keep in mind that the color of the shoes, socks, and belt should match.\n\nAccording to Guttilla, girls should stick with skirts or pantsuits, and opt for flats or low heels. Stockings or tights are a must; bare legs are a no-no. In addition, Guttilla advised wearing only a simple necklace and bracelet, and keeping the make-up light and natural.\n\n“You want to impress them,” Guttilla said. It is important, though, to look like you belong. Ken Mattsson, an assistant director at Career Services, agreed. The outfit should reflect the job and the industry. “You want to be seen as one of them,” he said.\n\nMattsson also suggested dressing “one level more formal than the people” you’ll hopefully be working with. Ultimately, he said, you want their first impression of you to be that you look professional.\n\nOne way to ensure this is to remove anything distracting from your ensemble such as chunky or over-the-top accessories, and even perfume. “You don’t want anything that would distract the interviewer from what you have to offer,” Mattsson said.\n\nThis also applies to the amount of skin you show. Mattsson stated that many students often forget about this, and make the mistake of wearing things like fishnets and mini-skirts or low-cut tops to an internship fair or interview.\n\nHis suggestion is to find a way to show your creativity through your clothing that neither distracts nor shows too much skin. He said your ultimate goal is for the clothes to fade away and the interviewer to focus on your qualifications.\n\nThis doesn’t mean that professionalism has to be drab though. According to Guttilla, the best way to reflect your own style is through smaller pieces. He suggested personalizing with a tie or even bowtie for guys, and for ladies with the choice of shoe color and accessories.\n\nIf you’re completely lost, don’t lose hope. Some stores like Macy’s and Anthropologie have personal shoppers.\n\nJ.Crew offers complimentary personal shopping to customers with queries. Personal shopper AJ DiPirro at the store’s Boston location offered his expert advice for women: investing in a three-piece suit (jacket, skirt, and trouser).\n\nThis way, DiPirro said, you have versatility in your outfit choices to make many different ensembles. However, he did recommend wearing the jacket and trouser on the first interview, and saving the skirt for the more relaxed second interview.\n\nWhether you plan to work in a firm, the newsroom, or behind the camera, the most important thing to remember is to look the part. Be professional and look like you belong, but keep a hint of you in there.\n\n&nbsp;","dt":"2011-02-03 02:14:25 -0500"},"345":{"terms":[{"id":12,"name":"Auntie Em"},{"id":5,"name":"Lifestyle"}],"title":"Female Resident","body":"Dear Auntie Em,\n\nI have the most repulsive suitemates.

For a number of students, the unreliable and lengthy process of loading a web page on the college’s wireless Internet server is equally frustrating.\n\nFreshman Mike Tingley said he has issues almost every time he tries to get on the Internet, and it has been noticeably worse since returning from break.\n\n“Whenever I try to log on it will load a 16th of the page and then stay frozen like that forever,” said the broadcast journalism major. “I’ll just sit there clicking my [mouse] pad and refreshing the page to the point where I want to throw my computer out the window.”\n\nTingley said the shoddy service has begun to affect his ability to complete his schoolwork.\n\n“The Internet will go out right when I’m trying to submit a response on WebCT, which is due at a certain time,” he said. “My parent’s aren’t paying money for my Internet not to work.”\n\nRichard Grossman, director of information technology, said the college’s six-year-old WiFi network slows under the stress of increased users and interference from students’ independent wireless devices.\n\n“We are absolutely aware of the problem, and it is absolutely at the forefront of our minds,” Grossman said. “There has been a significantly increased demand for wireless Internet the past few weeks; we’re trying to make the necessary changes to solve that issue.”\n\nThe finicky Internet service is waring on students who said they frequently find themselves waiting 20 minutes for a page to load, or at times find themselves unable to get online at all.\n\nFreshman Mahesh Harwani said ECmobile lags at random and often inopportune times.\n\n“[The Internet] gives out right when you really need it without warning,” said the marketing communication major. “For a fine institution like Emerson College, it is less than satisfactory.”\n\nGrossman said the college plans to renovate parts of the network’s infrastructure, but declined to say the improvements would begin.\n\n“We’re working with a six-year-old wireless system, which we’re trying to update,” Grossman said. “We plan to upgrade the firmware and software in some devices we have, while some equipment will be replaced.”\n\nGrossman said his department recently began heat-mapping with the system, a process that pinpoints areas with the weakest WiFi. But he said it’s time to hire outside professionals.\n\n“We’re trying multiple different solutions to address the problem,” he said. “We’re replacing some of the older gear, and doing internal heat mapping ourselves, as well as having the vendor do an internal heat mapping as well, which will help a lot.”\n\nUntil the problems are solved, many students say they will resort to plugging in their Ethernet cables in order to gain satisfactory Internet access.\n\n“[The wireless] kicks me off all the time and is always so slow,” said freshman film production major Cassie Susemihl. “I use my Ethernet cable all the time.”\n\n&nbsp;","dt":"2011-02-03 03:46:46 -0500"},"355":{"terms":[{"id":6,"name":"News"}],"title":"Sophomore fears for family in Egypt as father reports on anti-gov’t protests","body":"<!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 15.0px Arial} p.p2 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 16.0px Times; min-height: 19.0px} --><strong>Anum Hussain, Beacon Staff</strong>\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_356\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"150\" caption=\"Photo Courtesy of Hannah Fleishman\"]<a href=\"http://www.berkeleybeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/100_1178.jpg\"><img class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-356\" title=\"100_1178\" src=\"http://www.berkeleybeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/100_1178-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>[/caption]\n\nAt 11:30 Wednesday morning, sophomore Hannah Fleishman received a call from Cairo, Egypt. It was her mother.\n\nClare Fleishman told her daughter that protesters in Egypt, who are demanding a democratic country, have split into two opposing parties after President Hosni Mubarak announced he will not seek re-election in September. One half has been satisfied, while the other wants Mubarak to resign immediately, Fleishman said.\n\nThe marketing communication major watched as the two parties tossed Molotov cocktails at each other on Al Jazeera live.\n\n“I told my mom I was scared,” said Fleishman, who moved to Egypt in 11th grade and speaks to her parents in Cairo every other day. “I’ll be in tears, and they’ll say it’s not that bad. My mom goes to the grocery store and dad goes into downtown. I want to be there; be there to witness it.”\n\nFleishman first heard of the prospects of a protest when her father, a foreign correspondent for the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>, called to tell her he was going to report on it. Three days later, Egypt made frontpage headlines in every major newspaper.\n\n“I consider it home,” said Fleishman, who most recently visited the Middle Eastern country over Christmas break and hopes to return in the Spring. “I feel nostalgic for it all the time. When I saw it happening on TV, I started crying. It’s hard to see a place you come from falling apart like that.”\n\nFleishman added that most of the protesters are in their mid-20s, not much older than her classmates at Emerson, many of whom are seniors hunting for jobs.\n\nSimilarly, those in Egypt are facing unemployment in a repressive environment, according to Joshua Rubenstein, northeast regional director of Amnesty International U.S.A.\n\n“People go to college, graduate with skills and training but can’t find jobs,” Rubenstein said in a phone interview with the <em>Beacon</em>, speaking from his office in Somerville, Mass. “In a society where they cannot express themselves, that frustration doesn’t have a legitimate outlet, which is part of what’s fueling these demonstrations.”\n\nAs the events in Egypt unfold, Rubenstein said there have been executions and imprisonment of journalists. Just yesterday CNN’s Anderson Cooper was pummeled by protesters’ fists.\n\n“Got roughed up by thugs in pro-mubarak crowd… punched and kicked repeatedly. Had to escape. Safe now,” Cooper tweeted Wednesday.\n\nMore than 1,200 American citizens in Egypt have been evacuated, according to a daily press briefing Monday on the U.S. Department of State’s website.\n\nBut Fleishman said her father Jeff is still stationed in Cairo. Although he was supposed to move to Kenya in March, the revolution in Egypt may keep him in Cairo for another year, Fleishman said.\n\n“He doesn’t even want to leave; that’s where the story is,” Fleishman said, adding that her parents have a 4 p.m. curfew for safety, imposed by Mr. Fleishman’s job. “When this started I got really scared, but he doesn’t seem too worried about getting attacked or hurt.”\n\nFleishman said she will be participating in a protest for Egypt in Boston this Saturday at an announced location. The protest is the second of its kind, following a demonstration last Saturday where hundreds marched from Harvard Square into downtown Boston.\n\n&nbsp;","dt":"2011-02-03 03:49:39 -0500"},"358":{"terms":[{"id":6,"name":"News"}],"title":"Number of applicants spikes, particularly minorities","body":"<!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 16.0px Times New Roman} p.p2 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 16.0px Times; min-height: 19.0px} --><strong>Katie Prisco-Buxbaum, Beacon Staff</strong>\n\nEmerson College experienced a 21 percent jump in minority applicants over the past year, after new initiatives to increase diversity on campus were put in place.\n\nMJ Knoll-Finn, vice president of student enrollment, said Emerson sent student volunteers to high schools in their hometowns to talk to guidance counselors and perspective students. The college invited some guidance counselors to visit Emerson to familiarize themselves with the school and its programs as part of the Strategic Diversity Plan.\n\n“Last year the college paid for guidance counselors from high schools serving predominantly urban, minority students to fly to Boston and get acquainted with the college’s professors and academic programs,” Knoll-Finn said.\n\nKnoll-Finn said the Strategic Diversity Plan, a set of goals mapping out strategies to increase minority applicants, was started at the request of alumni, the Board of Trustees and students. One goal of this plan is to keep the percentage of diverse students at a minimum of 20 percent, which Emerson has exceeded by about four percent.\n\n“We have an obligation as a higher education community to prepare our students to go into a world that is diverse,” said Gwendolyn Bates, associate vice president for diversity and inclusion. “It’s not enough to attract and retain people of color, it is also important for us to make everyone on campus feel like they are part of the community.”\n\nRamon Calderon, a Latino freshman, was influenced by his guidance counselor and a teacher who is an Emerson alum to apply. Calderon, not knowing much about the school at the time, based his decision to apply solely on those recommendations.\n\n“Everyone looks at Emerson as a gay school or a hipster school and I feel that a majority of the students here are Caucasian,” the writing, literature, and publishing major said. “I do like that [the college] is reaching out to diverse people because a lot of people haven’t heard of Emerson.”\n\nCalderon said he has debated his suitemates over the validity of affirmative action at Emerson.\n\nHe refuted one suitemate who said that Calderon was accepted because of his Hispanic background, citing that he was valedictorian and had a high involvement in extra-curricular organizations. Ultimately, the debate ended with one conclusion, Calderon said: although trying to increase diversity at Emerson is a good thing, accepting someone into a school based on race is not.\n\nCalderon said that advertising the school’s desire to raise diversity can make it seem as if the process is more about numbers than credentials.\n\n“I think that trying to recruit more people from diverse backgrounds is good, but doing it just for the sake of looking good is not the reason you should accept someone,” he said.\n\nJon Allen, an African American freshman, said he believes that the strides Emerson is making will have a positive effect on the Emerson community.\n\n“I think it is good that they are targeting diverse students,” said the marketing major. “Emerson only accepts the best of the best students anyways; diversity only will benefit the school and allow students to learn from people with different cultures.”\n\n&nbsp;","dt":"2011-02-03 03:53:33 -0500"},"169":{"terms":[{"id":3,"name":"Arts &amp; Entertainment"}],"title":"Emerson Idol: The search for the next EVVY superstar","body":"<strong>Alicia Lazzaro, Beacon Correspondent</strong>\n<em>Tim Strain, Beacon Staff, contributed reporting</em>\n\nAmerican Idol has come to Emerson with the competition for the new EVVY Award for Outstanding Vocal Performer.

Each hopeful performed in front of the four producers of the show.\n\nJunior theater studies major Claire Kaiser, one of the final ten, said singing her rendition of “Don’t Rain on My Parade” was a unique experience.\n\n“I usually do musical theater on stage,” she said in a phone interview with the Beacon. “I didn’t know what to expect with four strangers and a camera in front of me…they had me pretend I got stung by bees and then sing.”\n\nWyso said that the pressure is necessary.\n\n“It’s designed that way because people that stand out in a pressure situation in front of four people will also stand out in front of thousands,” he said.\n\nAfter a series of callbacks, the top ten were chosen by the producers. For the past two weeks, the public has had the chance to vote for their favorite on the EVVY website. The public vote, which includes people outside of Emerson, counts for 25% of the overall vote; the remainder is filled by three industry professionals. Each judge will rank the performers on a scale from one to 10, with each judge having a quarter of the vote.\n\nThe first is Eric Hutchinson, a singer-songwriter and Emerson alumnus who has released three albums and performed in the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade. Second is Renee Grant-Williams, a vocal coach known for working with singers Miley Cyrus and Christina Aguilera. Don Grossinger is the last judge. He has worked as a sound mastering engineer and brings 25 years of experience and millions of records sold to the judges’ table.\n\nAll ten candidates plastered their Facebooks and Twitters with pleas to get out the vote.\n\n“We had to shut down the polls for an hour [a week ago] because the system was at max capacity…so we had to expand the system and how many votes it could take,” said Pat Lambert, creative executive producer and senior communication studies major.\n\nOnce the top three are revealed, the finalists will work to perfect their acts and to perform live at the EVVYs. Before they ham it up on stage, however, a short video will be played to show the road that each performer took to get to the Cutler.\n\n“We now have footage of them from the casting to this competition to once they are cast then finding out the dancers and working through the production and working with their vocal coach,” said Lambert.\n\nThe top three will perform on May 14, and at the end of the show an announcement will be made for everyone to text in their vote. Anyone watching, in the audience or at home, can vote. The grand prize-winner will be solely based on the public vote.\n\n“The EVVY Awards is essentially Emerson’s homecoming; it is our year-end gala where students from all walks of life, all different majors, come together and celebrate the past year at Emerson College and all the work they have done,” said Wyso. “It’s all about supporting your friends and family supporting their children.”\n\nKaiser can relate. “Cousins I haven’t talked to in years are leaving me messages. My aunt, friends from high school, people from my hometown. The support has been awesome.”\n\nLambert, too, said he is excited about the program.\n\n“It has always been a gigantic show, but this has been the year that it is at a new peak,” said Lambert. “The show has got lots of things that are different this year; but you will just have to come to find out.”","dt":"2011-02-10 00:44:33 -0500"}}
